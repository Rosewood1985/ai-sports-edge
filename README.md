## Quick Start

### Firebase Integration
```bash
# Deploy to production with verification
./scripts/deploy-to-firebase.sh

# Deploy to preview channel
./scripts/test-deployment.sh --preview
```

The deploy-to-firebase.sh script includes:
- Git status check before deployment
- Automatic build and deployment to Firebase
- Verification of Firebase site and custom domain
- Stripe configuration check
- Integration with post-deploy validation
- Cleanup of temporary files
- Logging to status/status-log.md

### Project Analysis

## VSCode Integration

All tools are available as VSCode tasks. To run a task:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Select from the available tasks

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing the Remote Deployment Validation System (File Fetcher, Hash Validator)
2. Implement Visual QA Trend Visualization based on the architecture
3. Extend Progress Backfilling System to other long-running operations

## Directory Structure

```
/scripts     → CLI and automation scripts
/functions   → Firebase functions
/public      → Static assets
/status      → Logs (e.g. status-log.md)
/tasks       → Task and changelog files
/docs        → Technical/user documentation
/src         → React Native and web frontend code
/.roocode    → Tool usage logs and session templates
/reports     → Generated reports from status checks
```

All scripts have been made executable and are ready to use. This comprehensive solution will help streamline Firebase integration, migration, project analysis, file organization, and development workflows for AI Sports Edge.
