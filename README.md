## Key Features Documentation

### Multi-Language Support

The app supports multiple languages with an easy-to-use language selection system. See [Language System Documentation](docs/language-system.md) for details on:

- How to use translations in components
- Adding new translations
- Adding new languages

- Best practices

### Microtransaction System

The app includes a sophisticated microtransaction system for monetization. Key features include:

- Frequency control to prevent overwhelming users
- Enhanced error handling and retry mechanisms
- Purchase history tracking
- Server-side validation

### Database Consistency Triggers

The app uses Firebase Cloud Functions to maintain data consistency between duplicated fields in the database:

- `syncSubscriptionStatus`: Syncs subscription status from subscriptions subcollection to users collection
- `syncCustomerId`: Syncs customer ID changes from users collection to subscriptions subcollection
- `standardizeStatusSpelling`: Standardizes "canceled"/"cancelled" spelling across collections

See [Database Consistency Guide](database-consistency-triggers-guide.md) for details on:

- Deployment instructions
- Testing procedures
- Monitoring recommendations
- Implementation details

### Theme Support

The app supports both light and dark themes, automatically switching based on device settings.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the React Native community guidelines
