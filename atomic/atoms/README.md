# Atoms

Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of our application. They are the smallest, indivisible units that maintain their functionality.

## What belongs here:

- **Primitive UI components**: buttons, input fields, icons, labels
- **Core utilities**: simple helper functions, formatters, validators
- **Constants**: color definitions, theme values, configuration constants
- **Basic hooks**: simple custom hooks with single responsibility
- **API primitives**: basic API request functions, endpoint definitions

## Guidelines:

1. Atoms should have a single responsibility
2. Atoms should be highly reusable
3. Atoms should not depend on other molecules or organisms
4. Atoms should be stateless when possible
5. Atoms should be thoroughly tested
