# Spanish Language Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document provides information about the Spanish language testing for the AI Sports Edge application. The tests verify that the Spanish translations are working correctly across the app, including the new features we've added.

## Test Files

- `__tests__/i18n/spanish-language-test.js`: Contains the Jest tests for Spanish language functionality
- `__tests__/run-spanish-tests.js`: Script to run the Spanish language tests and generate a summary
- `__tests__/spanish-testing-summary.md`: Summary of the test results (generated by the run-spanish-tests.js script)

## Running the Tests

To run the Spanish language tests, execute the following command from the project root:

```bash
node __tests__/run-spanish-tests.js
```

This will run the tests and generate a summary in `__tests__/spanish-testing-summary.md`.

## Test Coverage

The Spanish language tests cover the following areas:

1. **Login Screens**
   - Verifies that the LoginScreen displays text in Spanish when the language is set to Spanish
   - Verifies that the NeonLoginScreen displays text in Spanish when the language is set to Spanish

2. **Home Screen**
   - Verifies that the HomeScreen displays text for new features in Spanish when the language is set to Spanish

3. **Enhanced Analytics Dashboard**
   - Verifies that the EnhancedAnalyticsDashboardScreen displays text in Spanish when the language is set to Spanish

4. **Betting Slip Import**
   - Verifies that the BettingSlipImportScreen displays text in Spanish when the language is set to Spanish

5. **Language Switching**
   - Verifies that the language can be switched from Spanish to English and back

## Translation Files

The Spanish translations are stored in `translations/es.json`. This file contains all the text strings used in the app, organized by feature or screen.

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests for Spanish language functionality:

1. Add the new test to `__tests__/i18n/spanish-language-test.js`
2. Run the tests using `node __tests__/run-spanish-tests.js`
3. Check the summary in `__tests__/spanish-testing-summary.md`

## Adding New Translations

To add new translations for a feature:

1. Add the English strings to `translations/en.json`
2. Add the corresponding Spanish strings to `translations/es.json`
3. Use the `useI18n` hook in your component to access the translations
4. Add tests for the new translations in `__tests__/i18n/spanish-language-test.js`

## Best Practices for Internationalization

1. **Use the Translation System**: Always use the translation system (`useI18n` hook) for text that will be displayed to users.

2. **Avoid Hardcoded Strings**: Don't hardcode strings in components. Instead, use the translation keys.

3. **Use Placeholders**: For dynamic content, use placeholders in the translation strings. For example:
   ```json
   "welcome": "Bienvenido, {{username}}!"
   ```

4. **Test Both Languages**: Always test both English and Spanish versions of the app to ensure that the translations are working correctly.

5. **Keep Translations Organized**: Organize translations by feature or screen to make them easier to maintain.

6. **Consider Text Length**: Spanish text is often longer than English text. Make sure your UI can accommodate longer text strings.

7. **Consider Cultural Differences**: Be aware of cultural differences when translating. Some concepts may not translate directly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Spanish language tests:

1. **Missing Translations**: Check that all required translations are present in `translations/es.json`.

2. **Incorrect Keys**: Ensure that the translation keys used in the components match the keys in the translation files.

3. **Test Setup Issues**: Check that the test setup is correct, including mocks for services and components.

4. **Language Context**: Ensure that the language context is properly set up in the tests.

## Conclusion

The Spanish language testing ensures that the app is properly internationalized and that Spanish-speaking users have a good experience. By following the best practices and maintaining comprehensive tests, we can ensure that the app remains accessible to a wider audience.
