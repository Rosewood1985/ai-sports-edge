feat: Add script to fix build location on server after SFTP upload

- Created deploy-and-fix-build-location.sh script that:
  - Uploads build folder via SFTP
  - Creates fix-build-location.sh script inside build folder
  - Executes the fix script on the server after upload
  - Moves all build files to the root directory on the server
  - Cleans up empty build folder on server
  - Logs deployment status

This script solves the issue where files uploaded to the build/ directory on the server need to be moved to the root directory for the site to function properly.
