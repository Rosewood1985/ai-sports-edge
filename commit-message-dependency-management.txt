feat(deps): implement comprehensive dependency management system

This commit adds a robust dependency management system to address critical issues in the project:

- Create scripts/dependency-audit.js for comprehensive dependency analysis
  - Detect outdated packages, security vulnerabilities, and version conflicts
  - Identify ecosystem conflicts (React, testing, build tools, TypeScript, Firebase)
  - Generate detailed reports with recommended actions
  - Apply fixes for common dependency issues

- Create scripts/fix-react-test-renderer.js for targeted fixes
  - Align react-test-renderer version with React version
  - Install missing Sentry dependencies
  - Enhance Jest setup files to handle potential errors
  - Create fallback implementations for accessibility testing

- Add comprehensive dependency management documentation
  - Document common dependency issues and solutions
  - Provide best practices for dependency management
  - Establish workflow for future dependency updates
  - Include troubleshooting guidance

- Update memory bank with dependency management information
  - Add detailed progress tracking
  - Document decision to implement real solutions over workarounds
  - Update active context with current implementation focus

This implementation focuses on real solutions rather than workarounds, addressing the root causes of dependency issues instead of creating temporary fixes. It establishes a systematic approach to dependency management for the future.
