feat(docs): Implement comprehensive documentation consolidation system

- Created automated documentation consolidation system
- Categorized 2,761 markdown files into 9 logical categories
- Deduplicated files to remove redundancy (240 duplicates archived)
- Created structured directory system with master index
- Added maintenance scripts for future updates
- Updated run-full-consolidation.sh to properly format dates
- Made all scripts executable with proper permissions
- Added detailed README and summary documentation
- Set up automated weekly and monthly consolidation via cron jobs
- Implemented backup system with date-stamped archives

This consolidation provides a clean, organized documentation structure
that makes it easier to find and reference project information.
Categories include GPT personas, architecture, implementation plans,
features, business, deployment, UI/UX, workflows, and archives.

The documentation will be automatically updated weekly (Mondays at 3:00 AM)
and monthly (1st of each month at 2:00 AM) to ensure it stays current.
Backups are created with date stamps for version control and recovery.
