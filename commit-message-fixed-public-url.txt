fix: set correct public URL and ensure .htaccess is included in deployment

This commit fixes critical deployment issues that were causing frontend rendering problems:

1. Sets the correct public URL (https://aisportsedge.app/) in package.json
   - Ensures all static asset paths are properly prefixed
   - Prevents 404 errors for JS/CSS files

2. Creates a comprehensive deployment script that:
   - Rebuilds the app with the correct public URL
   - Ensures .htaccess is included in the deployment
   - Comments out references to missing JS files
   - Provides multiple deployment methods with fallbacks

3. Fixes .htaccess configuration with:
   - Proper Content-Security-Policy headers
   - SPA routing for React
   - Correct MIME types for JavaScript and JSON files
   - X-Frame-Options via HTTP headers

This resolves the frontend rendering issues including black screen, infinite spinner,
and CSP/integrity errors by addressing the root causes: incorrect asset paths and
missing .htaccess configuration.

Closes #ISSUE-124
