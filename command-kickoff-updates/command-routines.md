## üìÅ Output Log

All scripts output to:  
`~/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/cron-log.txt`

Check this file to view:
- Successful runs
- Errors or failed executions
- Timestamps for each action

---

## üîÅ Instructions to Update

To update your cron schedule:
```bash
crontab -e
```
Then paste the updated block and `:wq` to save.

## üí° Tip for Future

If `.command` file names change, update both:
- The actual filename in your project folder
- The matching entry in `crontab -e`

This schedule can be mirrored inside `operating-structure.md` for GPT/Olive visibility.
