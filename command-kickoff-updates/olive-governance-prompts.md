    - "Trigger Rajiv to reflect on model improvement and generate unique odds."
  
## Social Media Formatting Prompts

    - "This post draft exceeds Twitter's 280 character limit, please review and approve the revised draft."
    - "Sloane, please revise Instagram caption to meet optimal length for engagement."

## Self-Improvement Prompts
- **Camille**:
  - Every Friday, Olive asks Camille to reflect on A/B testing results, learnings, and improvement areas for the next round of CTAs:
    - "Camille, based on this week's A/B testing, what new ideas do you want to try? How can we improve copy or CTAs moving forward?"
  
- **Rajiv**:
  - Every Sunday, Olive prompts Rajiv to reflect on model performance, improvement opportunities, and suggest creative new angles for betting odds:
    - "Rajiv, after reviewing this week's model data, what areas need improvement, and what unique derivative odds can we introduce?"
