feat(privacy): Implement comprehensive privacy features

Add privacy features to ensure compliance with data protection regulations:

- Add data retention policies with configurable retention periods
- Implement privacy preferences management for user consent
- Create data access request functionality
- Add data deletion request functionality
- Add Spanish translations for all privacy-related text
- Initialize privacy service in App.tsx
- Add comprehensive documentation

This implementation follows atomic architecture principles with:
- atoms: data categories and retention periods
- molecules: privacy managers and data retention utilities
- organisms: privacy service for app-wide integration

These features help ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations by:
- Automatically managing data lifecycle based on retention policies
- Providing user control over their data and privacy preferences
- Supporting data subject access and deletion requests
- Maintaining proper documentation of privacy features
