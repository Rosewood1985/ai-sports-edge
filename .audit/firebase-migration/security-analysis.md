## Dependency Mapping

### Primary Dependencies

1. **Firebase Authentication Core**
   - `src/firebase/config.js` initializes Firebase
   - `src/firebase/auth.js` depends on config.js
   - `src/firebase/index.js` depends on auth.js

2. **Atomic Architecture Authentication**
   - `src/atomic/atoms/firebaseApp.ts` initializes Firebase
   - `src/atomic/molecules/firebaseAuth.ts` depends on firebaseApp.ts
   - `src/atomic/organisms/firebaseService.ts` depends on firebaseAuth.ts

3. **Firestore Security Rules**
   - `firestore.rules` is a standalone component that defines security rules for Firestore

4. **Firebase Functions**
   - `functions/index.js` implements server-side security for Stripe integration
   - `functions/index.js` depends on Firebase Admin SDK

5. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Authentication tests mock Firebase Auth SDK
   - Stripe security tests mock API calls and validate security practices

### Cross-Component Dependencies

1. The authentication system is used by:
   - Firestore security rules (for user authentication checks)
   - Firebase Functions (for user creation hooks)
   - Client-side components (for login/signup flows)

2. The validation components are used by:
   - Authentication system (for input validation)
   - Subscription services (for payment validation)

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Identified Vulnerabilities

1. **Configuration Inconsistency**
   - The `firebase-config-fix-plan.md` document indicates there was an issue with Firebase configuration credentials across multiple files
   - Specifically, the `messagingSenderId` and `appId` had discrepancies
   - This could lead to authentication failures and security issues

2. **Duplicate Firebase Initialization**
   - Firebase is initialized in both the original structure (`src/firebase/config.js`) and the atomic architecture (`src/atomic/atoms/firebaseApp.ts`)
   - This duplication could lead to inconsistent authentication state and security issues

3. **Incomplete Webhook Signature Verification**
   - The Stripe webhook handler in `functions/index.js` does not fully implement signature verification
   - The code includes imports for verification but doesn't actually verify the signature

4. **Error Exposure**
   - Some error handling in the authentication system might expose sensitive information
   - The error messages in `src/firebase/auth.js` are user-friendly but could potentially leak information

### Inconsistent Security Practices

1. **Multiple Authentication Implementations**
   - The codebase has both the original authentication implementation and the atomic architecture implementation
   - This could lead to inconsistent security enforcement

2. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Some files use hardcoded Firebase configuration while others might use environment variables
   - This inconsistency could lead to security issues in different environments

## Special Migration Considerations

1. **Firebase Configuration Centralization**
   - The Firebase configuration should be centralized to avoid inconsistencies
   - The atomic architecture implementation provides a good pattern for this

2. **Authentication State Management**
   - The migration should ensure consistent authentication state management
   - Special attention should be paid to the transition between old and new authentication systems

3. **Firestore Rules Testing**
   - The Firestore security rules should be thoroughly tested during migration
   - Rules should be updated to match any changes in data structure

4. **Webhook Security**
   - The Stripe webhook handler should be updated to properly verify signatures
   - This is critical for payment security

5. **Error Handling Standardization**
   - Error handling should be standardized across the application
   - Special attention should be paid to not exposing sensitive information
