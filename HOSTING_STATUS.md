# AI Sports Edge Hosting Status

## Current Hosting Setup

We've switched entirely to Firebase hosting for better reliability and consistency.

## URLs

**Primary Firebase URLs:**
- https://aisportsedge-app.web.app (main)
- https://aisportsedge-app.firebaseapp.com (legacy)

**Previous SFTP URL (now disabled):**
- https://aisportsedge.app (problematic SFTP deployment - disabled)

## Design Status

‚úÖ **Repository**: All files have correct neon blue theme (#00F0FF)
- public/styles.css ‚úÖ 
- public/neon-ui.css ‚úÖ
- public/index.html ‚úÖ

üîÑ **Firebase Deployment**: In progress
- Workflow updated to use proper Firebase action
- Should deploy correct neon theme shortly

‚ùå **SFTP Deployment**: Disabled
- Was causing sync issues
- Deployment workflow disabled

## Next Steps

1. Firebase deployment should complete within 2-3 minutes
2. Verify design appears correctly on Firebase URLs
3. Optional: Point custom domain to Firebase if needed

## Design Verification

Once deployed, you should see:
- Neon blue primary color (#00F0FF) instead of old blue (#007bff)
- Dark backgrounds with neon accents
- All your previous design consistency work properly displayed

## Previous Work Confirmed ‚úÖ

Your comprehensive design consistency work WAS completed correctly:
- UI consistency improvements applied
- 60-30-10 color rule implemented  
- Neon UI design plan followed
- Files cleaned and organized

The issue was only with the SFTP deployment sync, not your design work.
