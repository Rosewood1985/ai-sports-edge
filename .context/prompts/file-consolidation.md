ROO CODE PROMPT: FILE CONSOLIDATION PHASE
After completing the Firebase atomic architecture migration of all files to the dev container, we need to begin the file consolidation process. This involves:

IDENTIFYING SIMILAR FILES: Find files with similar names, purposes, or functionality across the codebase.
ANALYZING FEATURE DIFFERENCES: For each set of similar files, analyze their unique features and implementations. For example:

File A might have a refined onboarding experience
File B might have accessibility features and security implementations
Both files serve similar core purposes

MERGING PROCESS:

Create a new consolidated file that preserves ALL valuable features from each source file
Ensure the merged file follows our atomic architecture pattern
Implement the most robust error handling from either file
Preserve all accessibility features
Maintain the most comprehensive security implementations
Keep the most refined UX elements

DOCUMENTATION:

Document which files were consolidated into each new file
Note any conflicts that were resolved during merging
Track reduction in file count

VALIDATION:

Ensure the consolidated file maintains all functionality of the original files
Verify that no features were lost in the consolidation

The goal is to reduce our total file count while creating more robust, feature-complete components that follow our atomic architecture pattern.
Please help implement this consolidation process, starting with identifying candidates for merging.
