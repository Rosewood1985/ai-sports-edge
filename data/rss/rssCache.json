      "content:encodedSnippet": "Since his inauguration, Donald Trump has been working hard in attempts to make America great again. However, he still manages to talk about his passion for mixed martial arts from time to time—with Conor McGregor's name being the point of discussion during a recent meeting.\nFrom the regular fan up to billionaire entrepreneurs, McGregor has divided opinion; as most elite athletes do. Some believe that his ability in the cage is overshadowed by his shortcomings outside of it, which are beginning to pile up in his absence from the sport.\nAfter Donald Trump announced Khabib Nurmagomedov as his favorite UFC fighter, things soured between the United States president and Conor McGregor.\nThe rift between the two was short-lived and 'The Notorious' was invited to attend the Starlight Ball alongside several other big-name celebrities.\nFast forward almost two months to Wednesday, March 12, where Donald Trump sat down in the Oval Office with Ireland's prime minister, Michael Martin. The two had much to discuss, with Conor McGregor being one of them.\n\"I do happen to like your fighter,\" Trump told Martin during their meeting. \"He's got the best tattoo I've ever seen.\"\n\"Conor's great, right. You have a lot of great Irish fighters, actually. Great fighters. I don't know what that is but Ireland's always had a lot of good fighters.\"\n\"[Do] you know why? Because they're tough people.

Light heavyweight champion <a href=\"https://www.mmaweekly.com/tag/alex-pereira\">Alex Pereira</a> puts his title on the line against top contender <a href=\"https://www.mmaweekly.com/tag/magomed-ankalaev\">Magomed Ankalaev</a> in the headlining bout.</p><p>Former featherweight champion <a href=\"https://www.mmaweekly.com/tag/alexander-volkanovski\">Alex Volkanovski</a> gave his breakdown of the matchup and revealed his prediction on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJf0CCGip7E\">his YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>\"Originally, when I heard about this fight I was like, this is is a tough matchup for Pereira. I still think it is a tough matchup,\" Volkanovksi said. \"But then the more and more I look into it and chat about it, Pereira, his takedown defense is getting better and better.\"</p><p>\"Let's remember his fight with Jan Blachowicz. (He) was able to stop takedowns, get back to his feet. Showed a lot of improvements in his takedown defense against a solid wrestler. Probably not as good as Ankalaev. I think Ankalaev's wrestling and grappling is going to be much better than Jan Blachowicz to be quite honest. But I think Pereira's confidence understanding - He's always had a good understanding, but now an even better understanding of the grappling, takedown defense. All that sort of stuff,\" continued Volkanovski. </p><p>\"The Great\" believes Pereira will be able to handle Ankalaev's grappling and avoid being submitted if the fight goes to the ground. </p><p>\"On the feet, Ankalaev, great fighter. Southpaw. Does some great things.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "With UFC 313 drawing closer, fighters and analysts are weighing in and providing their predictions for the light heavyweight championship main event. Light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira puts his title on the line against top contender Magomed Ankalaev in the headlining bout.\nFormer featherweight champion Alex Volkanovski gave his breakdown of the matchup and revealed his prediction on his YouTube channel.\n\"Originally, when I heard about this fight I was like, this is is a tough matchup for Pereira. I still think it is a tough matchup,\" Volkanovksi said. \"But then the more and more I look into it and chat about it, Pereira, his takedown defense is getting better and better.\"\n\"Let's remember his fight with Jan Blachowicz. (He) was able to stop takedowns, get back to his feet. Showed a lot of improvements in his takedown defense against a solid wrestler. Probably not as good as Ankalaev. I think Ankalaev's wrestling and grappling is going to be much better than Jan Blachowicz to be quite honest. But I think Pereira's confidence understanding - He's always had a good understanding, but now an even better understanding of the grappling, takedown defense. All that sort of stuff,\" continued Volkanovski. \n\"The Great\" believes Pereira will be able to handle Ankalaev's grappling and avoid being submitted if the fight goes to the ground. \n\"On the feet, Ankalaev, great fighter.
