feat(api): Implement enhanced API caching mechanism

This commit implements an enhanced API caching mechanism that provides a consistent caching solution for all API calls. The implementation follows the atomic architecture pattern and includes:

- New apiCache molecule for generic caching of API responses
- Enhanced apiService organism that uses the apiCache molecule
- Configurable cache TTL for different endpoints
- Memory and storage caching for optimal performance
- Automatic and manual cache invalidation
- Cache control for API calls
- Comprehensive documentation

This implementation improves app performance by reducing network requests and provides a better user experience, especially in scenarios with poor network connectivity.
