**Date:** May 11, 2025  
**Author:** Roocode Boomerang Mode  
**Status:** Analysis Only - Pending Review

This inventory provides a comprehensive overview of all payment-related systems in the AI Sports Edge project, including subscriptions, one-time purchases, microtransactions, and revenue reporting. The analysis identifies the most refined implementations and suggests opportunities for consolidation.

## 1. Core Payment Infrastructure

### Configuration Files

| File | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [`config/stripe.ts`](../config/stripe.ts) | Core Stripe configuration with publishable key and price IDs for all product types | ✅ Current |
| [`functions/stripeConfig.js`](../functions/stripeConfig.js) | Server-side Stripe initialization with secret key | ✅ Current |
| [`utils/stripeTaxConfig.ts`](../utils/stripeTaxConfig.ts) | Tax configuration for Stripe Tax integration | ✅ Current |

**Implementation Approach:** Configuration is properly separated between client and server. The `stripe.ts` file defines all product types (subscriptions, one-time purchases, microtransactions) in a centralized location.

**Consolidation Opportunity:** None - files are appropriately separated by concern.

## 2. Subscription Management

### Core Service Files

| File | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [`services/subscriptionService.ts`](../services/subscriptionService.ts) | Client-side subscription management focused on gift subscriptions | ⚠️ Partial |
| [`services/firebaseSubscriptionService.ts`](../services/firebaseSubscriptionService.ts) | Comprehensive subscription management with Firebase integration | ✅ Current |
| [`services/groupSubscriptionService.ts`](../services/groupSubscriptionService.ts) | Group subscription management for multi-user subscriptions | ✅ Current |
| [`services/subscriptionAnalyticsService.ts`](../services/subscriptionAnalyticsService.ts) | Analytics tracking for subscriptions | ✅ Current |

**Implementation Approach:** The subscription functionality is split across multiple service files, with `firebaseSubscriptionService.ts` being the most comprehensive implementation. It handles subscription creation, management, and verification.

**Consolidation Opportunity:** Consider merging `subscriptionService.ts` into `firebaseSubscriptionService.ts` as the latter is more comprehensive and up-to-date.

### Firebase Functions

| File | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [`functions/stripeSubscriptions.js`](../functions/stripeSubscriptions.js) | Core subscription management functions | ✅ Current |
| [`functions/subscriptionManagement.js`](../functions/subscriptionManagement.js) | Additional subscription management utilities | ✅ Current |
| [`functions/subscriptionGifting.js`](../functions/subscriptionGifting.js) | Gift subscription functionality | ✅ Current |
| [`functions/subscriptionAnalytics.js`](../functions/subscriptionAnalytics.js) | Subscription analytics tracking | ✅ Current |
| [`functions/autoResubscribe.js`](../functions/autoResubscribe.js) | Auto-renewal functionality | ✅ Current |
| [`functions/groupSubscriptions.js`](../functions/groupSubscriptions.js) | Group subscription management | ✅ Current |

**Implementation Approach:** Subscription functionality is modularized into separate Firebase functions files based on specific features.

**Consolidation Opportunity:** The modular approach is appropriate for Firebase functions, but ensure consistent error handling and logging across all files.

## 3. One-Time Purchases

### Service Files

| File | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [`services/paymentService.js`](../services/paymentService.js) | General payment processing service | ⚠️ Legacy |
| [`functions/stripePayments.js`](../functions/stripePayments.js) | Server-side payment processing | ✅ Current |

**Implementation Approach:** One-time purchases are handled through the general payment services and specific Firebase functions.

**Consolidation Opportunity:** Consider migrating functionality from `paymentService.js` to a TypeScript implementation that follows the atomic architecture pattern.

## 4. Microtransactions

### Service Files

| File | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [`services/microtransactionService.js`](../services/microtransactionService.js) | Client-side microtransaction management | ✅ Current |
| [`functions/lib/microtransactions.js`](../functions/lib/microtransactions.js) | Server-side microtransaction processing | ✅ Current |
| [`functions/src/microtransactions.ts`](../functions/src/microtransactions.ts) | TypeScript source for microtransactions | ✅ Current |

**Implementation Approach:** Microtransactions are implemented as small, one-time purchases for specific features like advanced player metrics, odds access, etc. The implementation includes proper validation and idempotency handling.

**Consolidation Opportunity:** Ensure consistent product definitions between client and server implementations.

## 5. Tax Management

### Service Files

| File | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [`services/stripeTaxService.js`](../services/stripeTaxService.js) | JavaScript implementation of tax service | ⚠️ Legacy |
| [`services/stripeTaxService.ts`](../services/stripeTaxService.ts) | TypeScript implementation of tax service | ✅ Current |

## 11. Duplicate/Legacy Files

The following files appear to be duplicates or legacy versions that should be considered for archiving:

1. [`services/stripeTaxService.js`](../services/stripeTaxService.js) - JavaScript version superseded by TypeScript implementation
2. [`screens/RedeemGiftScreen.tsx`](../screens/RedeemGiftScreen.tsx) - Duplicate of GiftRedemptionScreen.tsx
3. [`services/paymentService.js`](../services/paymentService.js) - Legacy implementation that should be migrated to TypeScript
4. [`xcode-git-ai-sports-edge/services/subscriptionService.ts`](../xcode-git-ai-sports-edge/services/subscriptionService.ts) - Duplicate in Xcode project

## 12. Consolidation Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following consolidation actions are recommended:

1. **Merge Subscription Services**:
   - Consolidate functionality from `subscriptionService.ts` into `firebaseSubscriptionService.ts`
   - Ensure all gift subscription functionality is preserved

2. **Standardize on TypeScript**:
   - Migrate `paymentService.js` to TypeScript
   - Remove `stripeTaxService.js` in favor of the TypeScript version

3. **Eliminate Screen Duplication**:
   - Merge `RedeemGiftScreen.tsx` into `GiftRedemptionScreen.tsx`

4. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Create a central payment systems documentation index
   - Ensure all payment-related documentation is cross-referenced

5. **Atomic Architecture Alignment**:
   - Ensure all payment-related services follow atomic architecture principles
   - Consider reorganizing some services into atoms/molecules/organisms structure

## 13. Implementation Approaches

The payment system uses several distinct implementation approaches:

1. **Subscription Model**:
   - Regular subscriptions (monthly/yearly)
   - Group subscriptions (multi-user)
   - Gift subscriptions (time-limited)

2. **One-Time Purchase Model**:
   - Weekend/Game Day passes (time-limited access)
   - Full feature unlocks (permanent access)

3. **Microtransaction Model**:
   - Pay-per-view for predictions
   - Feature-specific purchases
   - Parlay packages

4. **Freemium Model**:
   - Free tier with limited access
   - Premium features behind paywall
   - View limits with upgrade prompts

Each approach is implemented with appropriate UI components, services, and Firebase functions. The system is well-structured but would benefit from the consolidation recommendations above.
