## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a phased approach over 6 weeks:

1. **Foundation** (Week 1): Core infrastructure and basic functionality
2. **Reward System** (Week 2): Reward distribution and milestone tracking
3. **Leaderboard & UI** (Week 3): Leaderboard system and user interface
4. **Gamification & Polish** (Week 4): Badges, animations, and social features
5. **Testing & Optimization** (Week 5): Testing and performance optimization
6. **Launch & Monitoring** (Week 6): Deployment and performance monitoring

## Technical Architecture

The implementation leverages the existing technology stack:

- **Frontend**: React Native with the existing neon UI design system
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Functions, Analytics)
- **Integration**: Stripe for subscription management
- **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics with custom events and properties

## Resource Requirements

The implementation requires the following resources:

- **Team**: 9 team members across development, design, QA, and operations
- **Timeline**: 6 weeks from kickoff to launch
- **Budget**: Estimated $100,000 total implementation cost

## Expected Outcomes

Based on industry benchmarks and our specific implementation, we expect:

- **User Acquisition**: 20-30% increase in new user acquisition
- **Conversion Rate**: 15-20% conversion rate for referred users
- **Retention**: 15% improvement in retention for users engaged with leaderboards
- **Revenue**: 10-15% increase in overall revenue within 6 months

## ROI Projection
