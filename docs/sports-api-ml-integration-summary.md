    A[Phase 1: Data Collection] --> B[Phase 2: Data Normalization]
    B --> C[Phase 3: Model Enhancement]
    C --> D[Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring]
    
    A1[API Integration] --> A
    A2[Data Storage] --> A

    C1[Model Training] --> C
    C2[Model Evaluation] --> C
    
    D1[Deployment] --> D
    D2[Monitoring] --> D
```

### Phase 1: Enhanced Data Collection

- Integrate all identified APIs
- Implement rate limiting and error handling
- Set up data storage and versioning
- Create data validation processes

### Phase 2: Data Normalization and Feature Engineering

- Develop sport-specific data normalizers
- Create unified data schema
- Implement feature extraction for each sport
- Design feature selection pipeline

### Phase 3: Model Enhancement

- Update model architectures
- Implement cross-validation
- Train and evaluate models
- Fine-tune hyperparameters

### Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring

- Deploy models to production
- Set up A/B testing
- Implement performance monitoring
- Create automated retraining pipeline

## Implementation Timeline

The implementation will follow this timeline:
