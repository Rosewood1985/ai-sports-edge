## ADR-001: Adopt Atomic Design

### Status

Accepted (2024-01-15)

### Context

The AI Sports Edge application was growing in complexity, with an increasing number of components and screens. The existing component organization was becoming difficult to maintain, with inconsistent patterns and limited reusability. The team needed a more structured approach to component organization that would promote reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

### Decision

We decided to adopt the Atomic Design methodology for organizing components. This approach organizes components into five levels:

1. **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, text)
2. **Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms (form fields, search bars)
3. **Organisms**: Complex combinations of molecules and atoms (forms, headers)
4. **Templates**: Page layouts without specific content
5. **Pages**: Specific implementations of templates with content

### Consequences

#### Positive

- Clear component hierarchy and organization
- Improved component reusability
- Better maintainability through isolation
- Consistent design language
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- More efficient testing strategy

#### Negative

- Initial learning curve for the team
- Significant refactoring effort
- Some components don't fit neatly into the atomic model
- More complex directory structure

- Alternative approaches are documented in [Implementation Alternatives](implementation-alternatives.md)

## ADR-002: Use Firebase as Backend Service

### Status

Accepted (2023-09-10)

### Context

The AI Sports Edge application needed a backend service for authentication, data storage, and other server-side functionality. The team evaluated several options, including building a custom backend, using Firebase, or adopting AWS Amplify. The key considerations were development speed, scalability, and maintenance burden.

### Decision

We decided to use Firebase as the backend service for the application. This includes:

- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Firestore for database
- Firebase Storage for file storage
- Firebase Cloud Functions for serverless functions
- Firebase Analytics for user behavior tracking
- Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications

### Consequences

#### Positive

- Rapid development and quick time-to-market
- Reduced backend maintenance burden
- Built-in authentication and security
- Real-time data synchronization
- Scalable infrastructure
- Comprehensive analytics

#### Negative

- Vendor lock-in to Google's ecosystem
- Limited customization options
- Potential cost concerns at scale
- Learning curve for Firebase-specific patterns

## ADR-003: React Context for State Management

### Status

Accepted (2023-10-05)

### Context

The application needed a state management solution that would work well with the component-based architecture. The team evaluated several options, including Redux, MobX, Recoil, and React Context. The key considerations were simplicity, performance, and alignment with the component model.

### Decision

We decided to use React Context API as the primary state management solution, with the following approach:

- Create context providers for different domains (auth, theme, etc.)
- Use context consumers or the useContext hook to access state
- Implement custom hooks to encapsulate context usage
- Use local component state for UI-specific state

### Consequences

#### Positive

- Simpler API with no additional dependencies
- Better alignment with React's component model
- Easier onboarding for developers familiar with React
- Reduced boilerplate compared to Redux
- More flexible and less opinionated

#### Negative

- Potential performance issues with frequent updates
- No built-in DevTools for debugging
- No middleware support for side effects
- Potential for "context hell" with many providers

### Related Decisions

- ADR-001: Adopt Atomic Design

### Notes

- Context usage patterns are documented in the component guidelines
- Performance optimizations (memoization, context splitting) are implemented

## ADR-004: Custom UI Components

### Status

Accepted (2023-11-20)

### Context

The team needed to decide on a UI component library or approach for the application. The options included using an existing library like React Native Paper, Native Base, or UI Kitten, or building custom components from scratch. The key considerations were design flexibility, performance, and alignment with the atomic design methodology.

### Decision

We decided to build custom UI components from scratch, following these principles:

- Create atomic components based on atomic design principles
- Implement a consistent design language
