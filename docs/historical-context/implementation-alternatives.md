## Architectural Alternatives

### Component Organization Approaches

Several approaches to component organization were considered before adopting the atomic design pattern:

| Approach          | Description                                       | Pros                                                                            | Cons                                                                                        | Decision     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Feature-based** | Organize components by feature/domain             | - Clear domain boundaries<br>- Feature isolation<br>- Team ownership            | - Potential duplication<br>- Harder to maintain consistency<br>- Less reusability           | Rejected     |
| **Type-based**    | Organize by component type (buttons, forms, etc.) | - Clear categorization<br>- Easy to find components<br>- Consistency            | - No clear hierarchy<br>- No composition guidelines<br>- Harder to understand relationships | Rejected     |
| **Atomic Design** | Organize by complexity and composition            | - Clear hierarchy<br>- Composition guidelines<br>- Reusability<br>- Scalability | - Learning curve<br>- Initial refactoring effort<br>- More complex structure                | **Selected** |
