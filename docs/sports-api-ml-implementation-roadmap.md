## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

Before beginning implementation, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **API Keys**: Verify all API keys are valid and have sufficient quota:
   - Odds API: `fdf4ad2d50a6b6d2ca77e52734851aa4`
   - SportRadar API: Obtain production key
   - NCAA Basketball API: Obtain production key

2. **Development Environment**:
   - Update `.env` file in the ML API project with all API keys
   - Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
   - Install all required dependencies

3. **Data Storage**:
   - Set up MongoDB database for storing processed data
   - Create appropriate collections for each sport
   - Set up data versioning system

### 2. Initial API Integration

Start by enhancing the data fetcher to collect data from all APIs:

1. Update `api/ml-sports-edge/data/fetch.js` to include all APIs
2. Implement proper error handling and retry logic
3. Add rate limiting to avoid API quota issues
4. Test each API integration individually

### 3. Data Collection Schedule

Set up a data collection schedule to regularly fetch and store data:

1. Create a cron job to run daily data collection
2. Implement incremental data collection to minimize API usage
3. Set up logging and monitoring for data collection jobs
4. Create data validation checks to ensure quality

## Key Implementation Components

### 1. Enhanced Data Fetcher

The enhanced data fetcher will be the foundation of our integration. Key components include:

- **API Client Factory**: Creates appropriate API clients for each data source
- **Rate Limiter**: Ensures we don't exceed API quotas
- **Error Handler**: Manages API errors and implements retry logic
- **Data Validator**: Validates incoming data for consistency and completeness
- **Storage Manager**: Handles saving data to appropriate storage locations

### 2. Data Normalizer

The data normalizer will transform data from different sources into a consistent format:

- **Sport-Specific Normalizers**: Custom normalizers for each sport
- **Entity Mapper**: Maps entities (teams, players) across different data sources
- **Schema Validator**: Ensures normalized data adheres to expected schema
- **Conflict Resolver**: Resolves conflicts when data sources disagree

### 3. Feature Engineering Pipeline

The feature engineering pipeline will extract and create features for the ML model:

- **Base Feature Extractor**: Extracts common features across all sports
- **Sport-Specific Feature Extractors**: Extracts features unique to each sport
- **Feature Transformer**: Applies transformations (scaling, encoding, etc.)
- **Feature Selector**: Selects most relevant features for each prediction task

### 4. Model Training System

The model training system will use the extracted features to train prediction models:

- **Model Factory**: Creates appropriate models for each prediction task
- **Training Pipeline**: Manages the training process
- **Hyperparameter Tuner**: Optimizes model hyperparameters
- **Evaluation Framework**: Evaluates model performance
- **Model Registry**: Stores and versions trained models
