## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies

1. **Firebase Infrastructure**: The implementation depends on Firebase Firestore, Functions, and Analytics.
2. **Stripe Integration**: Subscription extension rewards depend on the Stripe integration.
3. **User Authentication**: The referral system depends on the existing user authentication system.
4. **App Store Approval**: Any changes to the app will require App Store approval.

### Risks

1. **Performance Degradation**: Leaderboard queries may slow down with large user base.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination, caching, and query optimization.

2. **Referral Fraud**: Users may attempt to game the system.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement robust fraud detection and prevention measures.

3. **Data Consistency**: Leaderboard updates may lead to inconsistent data.
   - **Mitigation**: Use transactions for critical updates and implement verification.

4. **User Experience Issues**: Complex UI may confuse users.
   - **Mitigation**: Conduct usability testing and implement progressive disclosure.
