## üîÑ Backfilling Methodology

This report was generated using the Roocode Progress Backfilling System, which:

1. Extracts timestamps from git commit history
2. Correlates commits with feature implementations
3. Identifies files that need organization based on project structure rules
4. Maintains a chronological record of development progress
5. Flags missing files and inconsistencies

The backfilling process preserves the complete historical record while updating the current status, ensuring that all development activities are properly documented and tracked.
