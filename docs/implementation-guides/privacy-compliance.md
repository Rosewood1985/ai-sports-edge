# Privacy Compliance Implementation Guide

This guide provides an overview of the privacy compliance features implemented in AI Sports Edge to meet GDPR and CCPA requirements.

## Overview

The privacy compliance system is designed following the atomic design pattern, with clear separation of concerns:

- **Data Layer (Atoms)**: Defines data types and categories
- **Business Logic Layer (Molecules)**: Implements data access and deletion functionality
- **UI Layer (Organisms)**: Provides user interface for managing privacy settings

## Architecture

### Data Layer (Atoms)

Located in `atomic/atoms/privacy/`:

- **privacyTypes.ts**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for privacy-related data structures
- **gdprConfig.ts**: Contains configuration for privacy request types and statuses
- **dataCategories.ts**: Defines data categories and their properties, including whether they can be deleted
- **storageUtils.ts**: Provides utilities for encrypting and anonymizing data

### Business Logic Layer (Molecules)

Located in `atomic/molecules/privacy/`:

- **DataAccessManager.ts**: Handles data access requests, including collecting and formatting user data
- **DataDeletionManager.ts**: Handles data deletion requests, including selective and full account deletion
- **PrivacyManager.ts**: Main entry point for privacy-related functionality
- **index.js**: Exports all privacy-related functionality

### UI Layer (Organisms)

Located in `atomic/organisms/privacy/`:

- **PrivacySettingsScreen.tsx**: User interface for managing privacy settings and requests
- **index.js**: Exports the privacy settings screen

## Key Features

### Data Access Requests

Users can request access to their personal data, which is collected from various sources in the app and formatted according to their preferences.

```typescript
import { createDataAccessRequest } from 'atomic/molecules/privacy';

// Create a data access request for all data categories
const request = await createDataAccessRequest(userId);

// Create a data access request for specific data categories
const request = await createDataAccessRequest(userId, ['profileData', 'usageData'], 'json');
```

### Data Deletion Requests

Users can request deletion of specific data categories or their entire account.

```typescript
import { createDataDeletionRequest } from 'atomic/molecules/privacy';

// Create a data deletion request for specific data categories
const request = await createDataDeletionRequest(userId, ['profileData', 'usageData']);

// Create a full account deletion request
const request = await createDataDeletionRequest(userId, undefined, true);
```

### Privacy Preferences Management

Users can update their privacy preferences, including consent for marketing communications, data analytics, third-party sharing, and profiling.

```typescript
import { updatePrivacyPreferences } from 'atomic/molecules/privacy';

// Update privacy preferences
const preferences = await updatePrivacyPreferences(userId, {
  marketingCommunications: true,
  dataAnalytics: true,
  thirdPartySharing: false,
  profiling: false,
});
```

### Consent Management

The system provides functionality for recording and checking user consent for various purposes.

```typescript
import { recordConsent, hasConsent } from 'atomic/molecules/privacy';

// Record user consent
const consent = await recordConsent(userId, {
  id: 'consent_123',
  userId,
  consentType: 'marketing',
  given: true,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  method: 'explicit',
  policyVersion: '1.0',
  policyText: 'I agree to receive marketing communications...',
});

// Check if user has given consent
const hasMarketingConsent = await hasConsent(userId, 'marketing');
```

## Data Categories

The system defines the following data categories:

| Category          | Description                                                     | Can Delete | Retention Period |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| accountData       | Information required to create and manage your account          | No         | 2 years          |
| profileData       | Information you provide to personalize your profile             | Yes        | 2 years          |
| contactData       | Information used to contact you                                 | Yes        | 2 years          |
| paymentData       | Information related to payments and subscriptions               | No         | 7 years          |
| usageData         | Information about how you use the application                   | Yes        | 1 year           |
| deviceData        | Information about the devices you use to access the application | Yes        | 1 year           |
| locationData      | Information about your geographic location                      | Yes        | 3 months         |
| communicationData | Records of communications between you and the application       | Yes        | 1 year           |
| marketingData     | Information used for marketing purposes                         | Yes        | 1 year           |
| thirdPartyData    | Information received from third parties                         | Yes        | 1 year           |

## Integration with UI

To integrate the privacy settings screen into your app, add it to your navigation stack:

```typescript
import { PrivacySettingsScreen } from 'atomic/organisms/privacy';

// In your navigation configuration
const Stack = createStackNavigator();

function AppNavigator() {
  return (
    <Stack.Navigator>
      {/* Other screens */}
      <Stack.Screen name="PrivacySettings" component={PrivacySettingsScreen} />
    </Stack.Navigator>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data that is necessary for the app's functionality.
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Only use data for the purposes for which it was collected.
3. **Storage Limitation**: Delete or anonymize data when it is no longer needed.
4. **Transparency**: Clearly inform users about what data is collected and how it is used.
5. **User Control**: Provide users with easy-to-use controls for managing their privacy preferences.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Data Retention**: Implement a system to automatically delete or anonymize data after its retention period.
2. **Enhanced Consent Management**: Add more granular consent options and improve the consent flow.
3. **Privacy Impact Assessments**: Implement tools for conducting privacy impact assessments for new features.
4. **Data Portability**: Enhance data export formats to improve interoperability with other systems.
5. **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging for all privacy-related actions.
