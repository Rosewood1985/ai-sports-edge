   - Data retention policies and utilities

2. **User Rights Implementation**

   - Data Access Manager for handling data access requests
   - Data Deletion Manager for handling data deletion requests
   - Data export functionality in various formats (JSON, CSV, XML)

3. **Consent Management System**

   - Consent Manager for handling user consent
   - Consent verification functionality
   - Privacy preferences management

4. **Privacy Dashboard UI**
   - Tabbed interface for managing privacy settings
   - Data access and deletion request management
   - Consent management UI with preference toggles

## Core Components

### Privacy Configuration

The privacy configuration is defined in `atomic/atoms/privacy/gdprConfig.ts`. This file contains:

- Enums for privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Supported regions (EU, California, etc.)
- Types of consent (marketing, analytics, etc.)
- Methods of consent collection (explicit, implicit, etc.)
- Privacy request types and statuses

### Data Types

The privacy data types are defined in `atomic/atoms/privacy/privacyTypes.ts`. This file contains:

- Interfaces for data access requests
- Interfaces for data deletion requests
- Interfaces for consent records
- Types for data formats and privacy preferences

### Data Retention

The data retention policies are defined in `atomic/atoms/privacy/dataRetentionPolicies.ts`. This file contains:

- Data retention periods for different data categories
- Utilities for calculating retention expiration dates
- Configuration for data anonymization vs. deletion

## User Rights Implementation

### Data Access Manager

The Data Access Manager (`atomic/molecules/privacy/DataAccessManager.ts`) handles data access requests, allowing users to request access to their personal data. It provides the following functionality:

- Creating data access requests
- Processing data access requests
- Collecting user data from various sources
- Generating data exports in different formats (JSON, CSV, XML)
- Providing download URLs for completed requests

Example usage:

```typescript
import { DataAccessManager } from '../atomic/molecules/privacy/DataAccessManager';

// Create a new Data Access Manager
const dataAccessManager = new DataAccessManager();

// Create a data access request
const requestId = await dataAccessManager.createDataAccessRequest(
  userId,
  ['accountData', 'profileData', 'usageData'],
  'json'
);

// Get a data access request
const request = await dataAccessManager.getDataAccessRequest(requestId);

// Get all data access requests for a user
const requests = await dataAccessManager.getUserDataAccessRequests(userId);

// Get the download URL for a completed request
const downloadUrl = await dataAccessManager.getDownloadUrl(requestId);
```

### Data Deletion Manager

The Data Deletion Manager (`atomic/molecules/privacy/DataDeletionManager.ts`) handles data deletion requests, allowing users to request deletion of their personal data. It provides the following functionality:

- Creating data deletion requests
- Processing data deletion requests
- Deleting or anonymizing user data from various sources
- Providing status updates on deletion progress
- Cancelling pending deletion requests

Example usage:

```typescript
import { DataDeletionManager } from '../atomic/molecules/privacy/DataDeletionManager';

// Create a new Data Deletion Manager
const dataDeletionManager = new DataDeletionManager();

// Create a data deletion request (full deletion)
const requestId = await dataDeletionManager.createDataDeletionRequest(userId, true);

// Create a data deletion request (partial deletion)
const requestId = await dataDeletionManager.createDataDeletionRequest(userId, false, [
  'usageData',
  'marketingData',
]);

// Get a data deletion request
const request = await dataDeletionManager.getDataDeletionRequest(requestId);

// Get all data deletion requests for a user
const requests = await dataDeletionManager.getUserDataDeletionRequests(userId);

// Cancel a pending deletion request
const success = await dataDeletionManager.cancelDataDeletionRequest(requestId);
```

## Consent Management System

### Consent Manager

The Consent Manager (`atomic/molecules/privacy/ConsentManager.ts`) handles user consent for various purposes, such as marketing communications, data analytics, third-party sharing, and profiling. It provides the following functionality:

- Creating consent records
- Retrieving consent records
- Checking if consent has been given for a specific purpose
- Managing privacy preferences
- Setting and getting user privacy region

Example usage:

```typescript
import { ConsentManager } from '../atomic/molecules/privacy/ConsentManager';
import { ConsentType, ConsentMethod } from '../atomic/atoms/privacy/gdprConfig';

// Create a new Consent Manager
const consentManager = new ConsentManager();

// Create a consent record
const consentId = await consentManager.createConsentRecord(
  userId,
  ConsentType.MARKETING,
  true,
  ConsentMethod.EXPLICIT,
  'User consented to marketing communications'
);

// Check if a user has given consent for a specific purpose
const hasConsent = await consentManager.hasUserGivenConsent(userId, ConsentType.MARKETING);

// Update privacy preferences
await consentManager.updatePrivacyPreferences(userId, {
  marketingCommunications: true,
  dataAnalytics: false,
  thirdPartySharing: false,
  profiling: false,
});

// Get privacy preferences
const preferences = await consentManager.getPrivacyPreferences(userId);
```

## Privacy Dashboard UI

The Privacy Dashboard UI (`screens/PrivacyDashboardScreen.tsx`) provides a user interface for managing privacy settings, including:

- Viewing and creating data access requests
- Viewing and creating data deletion requests
- Managing consent preferences
- Accessing privacy policy documents

The UI is organized into three tabs:

1. **Requests Tab**: Manages data access and deletion requests
2. **Consent Tab**: Manages privacy preferences
3. **Settings Tab**: Provides access to privacy policy documents

## Testing

The privacy components can be tested using Jest. Example test files are provided in the `__tests__/privacy` directory:

- `DataAccessManager.test.ts`: Tests for the Data Access Manager
- `DataDeletionManager.test.ts`: Tests for the Data Deletion Manager
- `ConsentManager.test.ts`: Tests for the Consent Manager

## Extending the Implementation

### Adding New Data Categories

To add new data categories for data access and deletion:

1. Update the data collection logic in `DataAccessManager.collectUserData()`
2. Update the data deletion logic in `DataDeletionManager.deleteUserData()`
3. Add any necessary data retention policies in `dataRetentionPolicies.ts`

### Adding New Consent Types

To add new consent types:

1. Add the new consent type to the `ConsentType` enum in `gdprConfig.ts`
2. Update the privacy preferences interface in `privacyTypes.ts`
3. Add UI elements for the new consent type in the Privacy Dashboard

### Supporting New Regions

To add support for new regions:

1. Add the new region to the `PrivacyRegion` enum in `gdprConfig.ts`
2. Update the region detection logic in the app
3. Add any region-specific compliance requirements to the relevant managers

## Best Practices

1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the app's functionality.

2. **Purpose Limitation**: Only use personal data for the purposes for which consent was given.

3. **Storage Limitation**: Delete or anonymize personal data when it is no longer needed.

4. **Transparency**: Clearly communicate to users what data is being collected, how it is being used, and their rights regarding their data.

5. **User Control**: Provide users with easy-to-use tools to exercise their privacy rights.

6. **Security**: Implement appropriate security measures to protect personal data.

7. **Documentation**: Maintain documentation of privacy practices and data processing activities.

## Conclusion

This implementation provides the core functionality needed for GDPR/CCPA compliance, including the ability for users to exercise their privacy rights. However, compliance is an ongoing process that requires regular review and updates as regulations and best practices evolve.
