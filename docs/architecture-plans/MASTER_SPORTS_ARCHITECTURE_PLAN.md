## 9. Critical Flags and Blockers

### 9.1 Immediate Action Required
🚨 **CRITICAL**: Remove all mock data from soccer historical service
🚨 **CRITICAL**: Verify Boxing data source availability before implementation
🚨 **CRITICAL**: Confirm API key availability for all intended data sources

### 9.2 Technical Debt
⚠️ Missing parlay analytics for 4 out of 5 existing sports
⚠️ No historical data services for any existing sports
⚠️ Mock data present in recently created soccer historical service

### 9.3 Business Risk
💰 Boxing implementation may be blocked indefinitely without viable data source
💰 Revenue projections assume real-time data availability for all sports
💰 March Madness timeline requires NCAA Basketball completion by February 2025

- **Rate Limiting**: Respect all API rate limits with proper queuing
- **Backup Sources**: Secondary data sources for critical operations

## 11. Success Metrics

### 11.1 Technical Metrics
- **API Response Time**: <200ms for all sport prediction endpoints
- **Data Accuracy**: >95% accuracy for all real-time data feeds
- **System Uptime**: >99.9% during peak sports seasons

## Conclusion

This master architecture plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for expanding AI Sports Edge into a 10-sport platform. The atomic structure ensures scalability and maintainability, while the phased approach manages risk and resource allocation.

**Next Immediate Actions**:
1. Remove mock data from soccer historical service
2. Verify Boxing data source availability
3. Complete NBA and NCAA Basketball implementations
4. Implement historical data services for all sports
5. Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout

The success of this expansion depends on securing reliable data sources and maintaining the high-quality atomic architecture established in the existing platform.
