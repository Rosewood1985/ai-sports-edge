## Overview

AI Sports Edge is committed to providing an accessible experience for all users, including those with disabilities. We follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards and implement accessibility features across the application.

## ARIA Attributes

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes are used throughout the application to provide additional context to assistive technologies like screen readers.

### Dashboard Components

Dashboard components include appropriate ARIA attributes to make them accessible:

```tsx
<View 
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityLabel="Chart title"
  accessibilityHint="Description of what the chart shows"
>
  {/* Chart content */}
</View>
```

### Chart Components

Chart components include detailed accessibility labels and hints:

```tsx
<View
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityLabel="Activity heatmap. Use arrow keys to navigate between days."
  accessibilityHint="Press Enter or Space to hear details about the selected day."
>
  {/* Chart content */}
</View>
```

## Keyboard Navigation

Keyboard navigation is implemented for interactive components to ensure they can be used without a mouse.

### Chart Navigation

Charts support keyboard navigation to allow users to explore data points:

- **Arrow keys**: Navigate between data points
- **Enter/Space**: Hear details about the selected data point
- **Tab**: Move focus between interactive elements

Example implementation:

```tsx
const handleKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent) => {
  switch (e.key) {
    case 'ArrowRight':
      // Move to next data point
      break;
    case 'ArrowLeft':
      // Move to previous data point
      break;
    case 'Enter':
    case ' ':
      // Announce details about the current data point
      break;
  }
};
```

## Screen Reader Support

The application provides comprehensive screen reader support to ensure users with visual impairments can access all content.

### Accessible Summaries

Charts include accessible summaries that provide an overview of the data:

```tsx
const accessibleSummary = `This heatmap shows ${totalActivities} activities over ${activeDays} active days out of ${numDays} total days. The most active day was ${mostActiveDate} with ${mostActiveCount} activities.`;

<View accessibilityLabel={accessibleSummary}>
  {/* Chart content */}
</View>
```

### Dynamic Announcements

The application uses dynamic announcements to provide real-time feedback:

```tsx
AccessibilityInfo.announceForAccessibility(
  `${dateString}: ${count} ${count === 1 ? 'activity' : 'activities'}`
);
```

## Focus Management

Focus management ensures that keyboard users can navigate the application efficiently.

### Focus Indicators

All interactive elements have visible focus indicators to help keyboard users understand where they are in the application.

### Focus Trapping

Modal dialogs trap focus to ensure keyboard users can't accidentally navigate outside the modal.

## Color Contrast

The application maintains sufficient color contrast ratios to ensure text and interactive elements are visible to users with low vision.

### Neon Theme

The neon theme has been tested to ensure all text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background.

### Dark Mode

Dark mode provides an alternative color scheme that may be more comfortable for some users with visual impairments.

## Internationalization

The application supports multiple languages and provides localized content for users who speak different languages.

### Translated Accessibility Labels

All accessibility labels and hints are translated to provide a consistent experience across languages:

```tsx
accessibilityLabel={t('charts.heatmap.accessibilityLabel')}
accessibilityHint={t('charts.heatmap.keyboardHint')}
```

### Right-to-Left Support

The application supports right-to-left languages to accommodate users who read in that direction.

## Testing

Accessibility features are regularly tested to ensure they work as expected.

### Automated Testing

We use automated testing tools to identify potential accessibility issues:

- ESLint with jsx-a11y plugin
- Accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Manual Testing

Manual testing is performed with:

- Screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, TalkBack)
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Various device sizes and orientations

### User Testing

We conduct user testing with people with disabilities to identify and address real-world accessibility issues.

## Future Improvements

Planned accessibility improvements include:

1. Implementing more robust focus management
2. Adding more detailed chart descriptions
3. Supporting more assistive technologies
4. Improving animation controls for users with vestibular disorders
