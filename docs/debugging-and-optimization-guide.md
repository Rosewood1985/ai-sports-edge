## Introduction

The AI Sports Edge application is a complex system with multiple components, services, and platforms. This guide provides a structured approach to debugging and optimizing the application to ensure a high-quality user experience.

## Debugging Scripts

We've created several debugging scripts to help identify and fix issues:

1. `scripts/ui-debug.sh` - Identifies UI issues across the app
2. `scripts/optimize-api-calls.sh` - Identifies API optimization opportunities
3. `scripts/design-consistency-check.sh` - Checks for design consistency issues
4. `scripts/debug-and-optimize.sh` - Runs all debugging scripts and generates a summary report

To run all debugging scripts at once:

```bash
./scripts/debug-and-optimize.sh
```

This will generate a summary report in the `logs` directory with all identified issues and recommendations.

## UI Debugging

### Common UI Issues

1. **Overlapping Containers**
   - Caused by absolute positioning without proper constraints
   - Fixed by using flexbox or grid layouts instead of absolute positioning
   - Check for `position: 'absolute'` without proper bounds

2. **Non-Responsive Elements**
   - Caused by hardcoded dimensions
   - Fixed by using relative units (%, flex) and responsive design patterns
   - Check for `width: 123` or `height: 456` without responsive considerations

3. **Text Overflow**
   - Caused by fixed width containers with variable text length
   - Fixed by using ellipsis, flexible containers, or multiline text
   - Check for long text in fixed-width containers

4. **Z-Index Conflicts**
   - Caused by improper stacking context management
   - Fixed by establishing a consistent z-index system
   - Check for multiple z-index values that might conflict

### UI Debugging Process

1. Run the UI debugging script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/ui-debug.sh
   ```

2. Address identified issues in components and screens
3. Test on multiple screen sizes and orientations
4. Verify with VoiceOver/TalkBack for accessibility

## API Optimization

### Common API Issues

1. **Redundant API Calls**
   - Caused by multiple components requesting the same data
   - Fixed by implementing a central data store or context
   - Check for duplicate fetch/axios calls to the same endpoint

2. **Missing Caching**
   - Caused by fetching the same data repeatedly
   - Fixed by implementing caching with TTL
   - Check for API calls without caching mechanisms

3. **Inefficient Live Updates**
   - Caused by polling instead of using WebSockets
   - Fixed by implementing WebSockets for real-time data
   - Check for setInterval with API calls

4. **Large Payload Sizes**
   - Caused by fetching more data than needed
   - Fixed by implementing pagination or field filtering
   - Check for large response objects with unused data

### API Optimization Process

1. Run the API optimization script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/optimize-api-calls.sh
   ```

2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
3. Replace polling with WebSockets for live data
4. Batch related API calls
5. Implement pagination for list data

## Design Consistency

### Common Design Issues

1. **Inconsistent Colors**
   - Caused by hardcoded color values
   - Fixed by using a centralized color system
   - Check for hardcoded hex colors (#RRGGBB)

2. **Inconsistent Typography**
   - Caused by hardcoded font sizes and styles
   - Fixed by using a typography system
   - Check for hardcoded fontSize, fontWeight, etc.

3. **Inconsistent Spacing**
   - Caused by hardcoded margin and padding values
   - Fixed by using a spacing system
   - Check for hardcoded margin and padding values

4. **Inconsistent Component Usage**
   - Caused by creating one-off components instead of reusing existing ones
   - Fixed by creating a component library
   - Check for similar components with slight variations

### Design Consistency Process

1. Run the design consistency check script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/design-consistency-check.sh
   ```

2. Implement a design system with colors, typography, and spacing
3. Create reusable components for common UI patterns
4. Ensure dark mode support throughout the app
5. Verify accessibility compliance

## Performance Optimization

### Common Performance Issues

1. **Render Bottlenecks**
   - Caused by unnecessary re-renders
   - Fixed by using memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
   - Check for components that render frequently

2. **Memory Leaks**
   - Caused by uncleared event listeners, timers, or subscriptions
   - Fixed by proper cleanup in useEffect
   - Check for missing cleanup functions in useEffect

3. **Large Bundle Sizes**
   - Caused by importing entire libraries
   - Fixed by code splitting and lazy loading
   - Check for large imports and unused code

4. **Unoptimized Images**
   - Caused by using large images without optimization
   - Fixed by using responsive images and proper formats
   - Check for large image assets

### Performance Optimization Process

1. Implement code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
2. Add memoization to expensive components and calculations
3. Optimize images with proper sizing and formats
4. Implement proper cleanup for subscriptions and timers

## Cross-Platform Testing

### Testing Process

1. Test on multiple iOS devices (different screen sizes)
2. Test on web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
3. Test with VoiceOver/screen readers
4. Test in dark mode
5. Test with Spanish language setting
6. Test offline functionality
7. Test live odds updates
8. Test parlay suggestions

### Automated Testing

Run the automated test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run unit tests, integration tests, and cross-platform tests.

## Deployment

### Deployment Process

1. Run all debugging and optimization scripts
2. Fix identified issues
3. Run the test suite
4. Deploy to staging environment
5. Perform manual testing
6. Deploy to production

### Deployment Scripts

1. `scripts/deploy-web.sh` - Deploys the web app to Firebase hosting
2. `scripts/deploy-ios.sh` - Builds and submits the iOS app to the App Store
3. `scripts/push-to-github.sh` - Commits and pushes changes to GitHub

For more details on deployment, see [Deployment Guide](./deployment-guide.md).
