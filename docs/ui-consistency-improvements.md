# UI Consistency Improvements

This document summarizes the UI design improvements applied across the AI Sports Edge application based on the provided guidelines. The goal was to create a more consistent, visually appealing, and readable user interface.

## Design Guidelines Applied

1.  **60-30-10 Color Rule:**
    *   Themes in `App.tsx` were updated to better reflect this rule using colors from `constants/Colors.ts`.
    *   Light Mode: White (60%), Dark Gray/Light Gray (30%), Blue (10%).
    *   Dark Mode: Near Black (60%), Light Gray/Gray (30%), Neon Blue (10%).
    *   Secondary background colors (`card`) were defined for both themes.
    *   Accent colors (`primary`) are used for interactive elements like buttons and links.
    *   Notification colors were kept distinct for alerts.

2.  **Visual Contrast:**
    *   Ensured text colors (`colors.text`) have sufficient contrast against background colors (`colors.background`, `colors.card`).
    *   Used opacity (`0.7`) for secondary text elements (e.g., email, dates, status) to differentiate them while maintaining readability.
    *   Button text color (`#ffffff`) ensures high contrast against the primary button background.

3.  **Standardized Shadows:**
    *   Applied a consistent drop shadow style to card elements (`styles.cardBase` in `HomeScreen.tsx`) and buttons (`styles.button` in `ProfileScreen.tsx`).
    *   Shadow properties: `shadowColor: '#000'`, `shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 }`, `shadowOpacity: 0.1` (or `0.15` for buttons), `shadowRadius: 4` (or `5`), `elevation: 3`.

4.  **Whitespace:**
    *   Introduced a base `SPACING_UNIT = 8` in `HomeScreen.tsx` and `ProfileScreen.tsx`.
    *   Updated margins and padding throughout these screens using multiples of the `SPACING_UNIT` (e.g., 8, 12, 16, 24, 32) to increase breathing room around sections, cards, text, and buttons.
    *   Increased vertical spacing between sections and list items.

5.  **Text Alignment:**
    *   Explicitly set `textAlign: 'left'` for most text elements, including section titles and body text.
    *   Used `textAlign: 'center'` for headers (`fallbackTitle` in `App.tsx`, `userName`, `userEmail` in `ProfileScreen.tsx`) and specific info elements (`gameDateText`, `unauthenticatedTitle`, `unauthenticatedSubtitle`).
    *   Team names and scores in `HomeScreen.tsx` remain centered within their containers.

## Files Modified

1.  **`App.tsx`**:
    *   Updated `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` definitions to align with `constants/Colors.ts` and the 60-30-10 rule.
    *   Added `icon` color property to themes.
    *   Refactored `styles` for the `fallbackUI` for consistency.

2.  **`screens/HomeScreen.tsx`**:
    *   Imported `useTheme` and applied theme colors (`colors.card`, `colors.primary`, `colors.border`, `colors.notification`) dynamically.
    *   Removed `ThemedCard` usage in favor of direct styling with `backgroundColor: colors.card`.
    *   Refactored `StyleSheet` using `SPACING_UNIT` for consistent margins and padding.
    *   Applied standard shadow style (`styles.cardBase`).
    *   Adjusted text alignment (left-align for titles, welcome text).
    *   Improved contrast using opacity for secondary text.
    *   Updated `ThemedText` usage after fixing the component to accept `numberOfLines`.

3.  **`screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`**:
    *   Imported `useTheme` and applied theme colors (`colors.primary`, `colors.border`, `colors.icon`, `colors.notification`) dynamically.
    *   Refactored `StyleSheet` using `SPACING_UNIT` for consistent margins and padding.
    *   Applied standard shadow style to buttons.
    *   Adjusted text alignment (left-align for section titles, menu items; center-align for header, unauthenticated text).
    *   Improved contrast using opacity for secondary text (`userEmail`, `planStatus`, `noSubscription`).
    *   Updated `auth` usage to `getAuth()`.

4.  **`screens/AuthScreen.tsx`**:
    *   Imported `useTheme` and applied theme colors (`colors.primary`, `colors.border`, `colors.notification`, `colors.text`, `colors.card`) dynamically.
    *   Refactored `StyleSheet` using `SPACING_UNIT` for consistent margins and padding.
    *   Applied standard shadow style to the main button.
    *   Adjusted text alignment (left-align for title, validation messages).
    *   Improved input field styling (consistent height, border, icon placement).
    *   Enhanced visual hierarchy and spacing for error messages, password strength indicator, and requirements checklist.
    *   Corrected JSX syntax errors introduced during refactoring.

5.  **`components/ThemedComponents.tsx`**:
    *   Updated `ThemedText` component to accept `TextProps` (including `numberOfLines`).

## Conclusion

These changes establish a more consistent and visually refined UI foundation based on the provided design guidelines. The use of theme colors, standardized spacing, shadows, and text alignment practices improves the overall look, feel, and readability of the application across the modified screens.
