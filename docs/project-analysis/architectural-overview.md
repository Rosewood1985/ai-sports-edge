# Architectural Overview

## System Architecture

AI Sports Edge follows a modern mobile application architecture with the following key components:

1. **Frontend**: React Native (Expo) application with TypeScript
2. **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions and Firestore
3. **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
4. **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration
5. **Push Notifications**: OneSignal integration
6. **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics

## Atomic Design Architecture

The frontend follows the Atomic Design methodology with components organized into:

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, icons)
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms functioning together (form fields, search bars)
- **Organisms**: Complex UI components (headers, forms, cards)
- **Templates**: Page layouts without specific content
- **Pages**: Specific instances of templates with real content

## Data Flow

The application follows a unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. User interactions trigger events
2. Events are handled by service modules
3. Services communicate with Firebase/external APIs
4. Data is returned to the UI components
5. UI is updated to reflect the new state

## Key Subsystems

### Notification System

- OneSignal for push notifications
- In-app notifications
- Scheduled notifications

### Analytics System

- User behavior tracking
- Conversion tracking
- A/B testing

### Localization System

- Multi-language support (English/Spanish)
- Region-specific content

## Deployment Architecture

- Mobile app deployed through app stores
- Web version deployed to GoDaddy via SFTP
- Firebase Functions deployed to Google Cloud
- Continuous integration with GitHub Actions

## Future Architecture Considerations

- Complete migration to TypeScript
- Further adoption of atomic design principles
- Enhanced offline capabilities
- Performance optimizations
