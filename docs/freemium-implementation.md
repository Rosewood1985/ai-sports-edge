This document provides an overview of the freemium model implementation in the AI Sports Edge app.

- **Teaser**: Content with a preview and upgrade overlay
- **Locked**: Content completely locked behind a paywall

```typescript
<FreemiumFeature
  type="blurred"
  freeContent={<Text>This is visible to free users</Text>}

  timeBasedUnlock={true}
>
  <Text>This content is blurred for free users</Text>
</FreemiumFeature>
