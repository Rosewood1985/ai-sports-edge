# Atomic Architecture Guide

This guide provides an overview of the atomic architecture and how to use it in your application.

## Overview

The atomic architecture is a design pattern that organizes components into a hierarchy based on their complexity and reusability. It is inspired by atomic design principles and provides a clear separation of concerns.

The atomic architecture consists of five levels:

1. **Atoms**: Basic building blocks
2. **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms
3. **Organisms**: Complex components
4. **Templates**: Layout structures
5. **Pages**: Complete screens

## Benefits

The atomic architecture provides several benefits:

- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific purpose
- **Progressive Complexity**: Components build from simple to complex
- **Reusability**: Lower-level components can be reused across features
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't affect others

## Implementation

The atomic architecture is implemented as a set of directories and files:

```
atomic/
  ├── atoms/
  │   ├── index.js
  │   ├── envConfig.js
  │   ├── firebaseApp.js
  │   └── ...
  ├── molecules/
  │   ├── index.js
  │   ├── themeContext.js
  │   ├── firebaseAuth.js
  │   └── ...
  ├── organisms/
  │   ├── index.js
  │   ├── environmentBootstrap.js
  │   ├── firebaseService.js
  │   └── ...
  ├── templates/
  │   ├── index.js
  │   ├── MainLayout.js
  │   └── ...
  ├── pages/
  │   ├── index.js
  │   ├── HomePage.js
  │   └── ...
  └── index.js
```

Each level has an `index.js` file that exports all components from that level, making it easy to import components.

## Usage

To use the atomic architecture in your application, follow these guidelines:

1. **Import from index files**: Use the index files to import components from the atomic architecture.
   ```javascript
   import { environmentBootstrap, firebaseService } from '../atomic';
   ```

2. **Use templates for layout**: Use templates to provide consistent layout across your application.
   ```javascript
   import { MainLayout } from '../atomic/templates';
   ```

3. **Use hooks for shared functionality**: Use hooks to access shared functionality like theme.
   ```javascript
   import { useTheme } from '../atomic/molecules/themeContext';
   ```

4. **Handle errors with monitoring service**: Use the monitoring service to handle errors.
   ```javascript
   monitoringService.error.captureException(error);
   ```

5. **Use service methods for data access**: Use service methods to access data.
   ```javascript
   const userData = await firebaseService.firestore.getDocument('users', currentUser.uid);
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep atoms simple**: Atoms should be simple and focused on a single responsibility.
2. **Compose molecules from atoms**: Molecules should be composed of atoms and provide more complex functionality.
3. **Organisms should be self-contained**: Organisms should be self-contained and provide complete functionality.
4. **Templates should be layout-focused**: Templates should focus on layout and structure, not functionality.
5. **Pages should compose from lower levels**: Pages should compose from templates, organisms, molecules, and atoms.
6. **Use index files for exports**: Use index files to export components from each level.
7. **Document components**: Document components with JSDoc comments and examples.
8. **Test components**: Test components at each level to ensure they work correctly.
