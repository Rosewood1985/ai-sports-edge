## Overview

The AI Sports News feature provides users with sports news enhanced by AI-generated summaries that focus on betting implications, fantasy sports impact, or general insights. This feature leverages natural language processing to analyze sports news articles and extract relevant information for sports bettors and fantasy sports players.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Data Collection**
   - Sports news API integration
   - Web scraping for additional sources
   - Real-time updates for breaking news

2. **AI Processing**

   - Custom prompt engineering for betting/fantasy focus
   - Firebase Cloud Functions for serverless processing

3. **User Interface**
   - News feed with categorized articles
   - AI summary highlighting
   - Focus switching (betting/fantasy/general)
   - Premium feature gating

## Implementation Details

### Backend Services

#### 1. Sports News Service (`sportsNewsService.ts`)
- Fetches sports news from The Sports DB API (free, no API key required)
- Categorizes news by type (injury, lineup, trade, general)
- Extracts teams and players mentioned
- Falls back to mock data if API fails or returns empty results

#### 2. AI Summary Service (`aiSummaryService.ts`)
- Interfaces with OpenAI API via Firebase Functions
- Generates summaries with different focus areas
- Caches results to minimize API calls
- Handles error cases gracefully

#### 3. Firebase Cloud Function (`aiSummary.js`)
- Serverless function for AI processing
- Securely manages API keys
- Implements rate limiting and caching
- Stores summaries in Firestore for retrieval

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Sports News Screen (`SportsNewsScreen.tsx`)
- Main UI for browsing news articles
- Category filtering (injuries, lineups, trades, general)
- Focus switching between betting, fantasy, and general insights
- Premium feature integration for AI summaries

#### 2. News Card Component
- Displays article title, source, and timestamp
- Shows teams and players mentioned
- Highlights AI-generated summary for premium users
- Provides read more functionality

## User Experience

1. **News Discovery**
   - Users can browse the latest sports news
   - Filter by category to focus on specific types of news
   - Pull to refresh for latest updates

2. **AI Insights**
   - Premium users see AI-generated summaries
   - Can switch focus between betting, fantasy, and general insights
   - Summaries highlight the most relevant information for each focus area

3. **Integration**
   - Accessible from the Settings screen

## Technical Considerations

### API Usage and Costs

The AI Sports News feature relies on two main external APIs:

1. **The Sports DB API**
   - Provides raw sports news data
   - Completely free with no API key required
   - No rate limits specified, but reasonable usage recommended
   - Estimated cost: $0/month

2. **OpenAI API**
   - Used for generating summaries
   - Charged per token (input + output)
   - Estimated cost: $0.02-0.05 per summary
   - With caching and rate limiting: $200-500/month

### Performance Optimization

To ensure good performance while managing costs:

1. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache AI summaries in Firestore
   - Reuse summaries for the same article
   - Invalidate cache after 24 hours

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Process news articles in batches
   - Schedule updates at regular intervals
   - Prioritize processing for popular articles

3. **Client-Side Optimization**
   - Lazy loading of news items
   - Progressive image loading
   - Virtualized lists for smooth scrolling

## Future Enhancements

1. **Personalization**
   - User-specific news feed based on favorite teams/sports
   - Personalized AI summaries focusing on user's betting history
   - Smart notifications for high-impact news

2. **Advanced AI Features**
   - Sentiment analysis for news articles
   - Automated odds impact prediction
   - Historical correlation analysis

3. **Social Integration**
   - Share news and AI insights with friends
   - Community discussion on news items
   - Expert commentary integration
