   - Builds and submits updates for the mobile app
   - Uses Expo Application Services (EAS) for building and updating

4. **`scripts/update-all.sh`**
   - Master script that runs all update scripts in sequence
   - Provides a single command to update everything

5. **`scripts/README.md`**
   - Documentation for all scripts in the scripts directory
   - Usage instructions and explanations

## How to Use the Scripts

### Update Everything

To update everything (documentation, web app, and mobile app) at once:

```bash
./scripts/update-all.sh
```

### Update Individual Components

To update specific components:

```bash
# Push documentation to GitHub
./scripts/push-docs-to-github.sh

# Update web app
./scripts/update-web-app.sh

# Update mobile app
./scripts/update-mobile-app.sh
```

For detailed instructions, refer to [Update Instructions](update-instructions.md).

## Implementation Plan

The implementation of the ESPN API and Bet365 API integrations will follow the roadmap outlined in [Sports API ML Implementation Roadmap](sports-api-ml-implementation-roadmap.md). The key phases are:

1. **Foundation (Weeks 1-6)**
   - Set up development environments
   - Implement basic data collection
   - Create data storage infrastructure

2. **Data Processing (Weeks 7-12)**
   - Implement data normalization
   - Create data merging framework
   - Set up historical data collection

3. **Feature Engineering (Weeks 13-18)**
   - Extract statistical and market features
   - Develop combined features
   - Optimize feature selection

4. **Model Enhancement (Weeks 19-24)**
   - Update model training pipeline
   - Develop sport-specific models
   - Implement validation framework

5. **Deployment (Weeks 25-30)**
   - Deploy prediction API
   - Set up monitoring and alerting
   - Update user interfaces

## Expected Benefits

The integration of ESPN API and Bet365 API is expected to provide significant benefits:

1. **Improved Prediction Accuracy**
