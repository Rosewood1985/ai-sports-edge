# Voice Control Accessibility Implementation

This document outlines the voice control accessibility features implemented in the AI Sports Edge app. Voice control allows users to navigate and interact with the app using voice commands, providing an alternative input method for users with mobility impairments or those who prefer voice interaction.

## Overview

The voice control system is built on top of the AccessibilityService and provides a way to register voice commands that can trigger actions within the app. The implementation is designed to be:

- **Extensible**: New voice commands can be easily added to any component
- **Consistent**: Voice commands follow a consistent pattern across the app
- **Discoverable**: Users can access a list of available voice commands
- **Configurable**: Users can enable/disable voice control in accessibility settings

## Implementation Details

### Voice Control Architecture

The voice control system consists of the following components:

1. **AccessibilityService**: Extended to support voice command registration and handling
2. **Voice Recognition**: Placeholder implementation that would be replaced with a real voice recognition library
3. **Command Handlers**: Functions that execute when a voice command is recognized

### Key Components

#### AccessibilityService Voice Control Methods

The AccessibilityService has been extended with the following methods for voice control:

```typescript
// Check if voice control is enabled
isVoiceControlEnabled(): boolean

// Enable or disable voice control
setVoiceControlEnabled(enabled: boolean): Promise<void>

// Register a voice command handler
registerVoiceCommand(handler: VoiceCommandHandler): () => void

// Get all registered voice commands
getVoiceCommands(): VoiceCommandHandler[]

// Add listener for voice recognition state changes
addVoiceRecognitionListener(listener: (isActive: boolean) => void): () => void
```

#### VoiceCommandHandler Interface

Voice commands are registered using the VoiceCommandHandler interface:

```typescript
interface VoiceCommandHandler {
  // Command phrase to listen for
  command: string;

  // Handler function to execute when command is recognized
  handler: () => void;

  // Description of what the command does (for help screens)
  description: string;
}
```

### Usage Examples

#### Registering a Voice Command

```typescript
import accessibilityService from '../../services/accessibilityService';

// In a component
useEffect(() => {
  // Register a voice command
  const unregister = accessibilityService.registerVoiceCommand({
    command: 'go to home',
    handler: () => navigation.navigate('Home'),
    description: 'Navigates to the home screen',
  });

  // Clean up on unmount
  return () => {
    unregister();
  };
}, [navigation]);
```

#### Enabling Voice Control in Settings

```typescript
import accessibilityService from '../../services/accessibilityService';

// Toggle voice control
const toggleVoiceControl = async () => {
  const isEnabled = accessibilityService.isVoiceControlEnabled();
  await accessibilityService.setVoiceControlEnabled(!isEnabled);
};
```

#### Displaying Available Voice Commands

```typescript
import accessibilityService from '../../services/accessibilityService';

// Get all voice commands
const voiceCommands = accessibilityService.getVoiceCommands();

// Display in a list
return (
  <FlatList
    data={voiceCommands}
    keyExtractor={item => item.command}
    renderItem={({ item }) => (
      <View>
        <Text style={styles.command}>{item.command}</Text>
        <Text style={styles.description}>{item.description}</Text>
      </View>
    )}
  />
);
```

## Common Voice Commands

The app includes the following common voice commands:

| Command         | Action                                  | Screen             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| "Go back"       | Navigates back to the previous screen   | All screens        |
| "Go home"       | Navigates to the home screen            | All screens        |
| "Open settings" | Navigates to the settings screen        | All screens        |
| "Scroll down"   | Scrolls the current screen down         | Scrollable screens |
| "Scroll up"     | Scrolls the current screen up           | Scrollable screens |
| "Select"        | Activates the currently focused element | All screens        |

## Integration with Screen Readers

Voice control is designed to work alongside screen readers, providing complementary functionality. When both are enabled:

- Voice commands can be used to navigate between elements
- Screen readers will announce the currently focused element
- Voice commands can be used to activate the currently focused element

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the voice control system include:

1. **Natural Language Processing**: Improve command recognition with NLP
2. **Contextual Commands**: Commands that are specific to the current screen or context
3. **Custom Commands**: Allow users to define their own voice commands
4. **Multi-language Support**: Support for voice commands in multiple languages
5. **Voice Feedback**: Audible feedback when commands are recognized

## Testing Voice Control

To test voice control functionality:

1. Enable voice control in accessibility settings
2. Speak a registered command clearly
3. Verify that the expected action occurs
4. Check the console for logs indicating command recognition

For automated testing, mock the voice recognition system to simulate voice commands.

## Best Practices

When implementing voice commands:

1. **Keep commands simple**: Use short, clear phrases
2. **Be consistent**: Use the same command pattern across the app
3. **Provide feedback**: Let users know when a command is recognized
4. **Document commands**: Include voice commands in help documentation
5. **Test with real users**: Get feedback from users with different accents and speech patterns
