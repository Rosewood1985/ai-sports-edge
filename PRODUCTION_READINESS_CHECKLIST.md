# Production Readiness Checklist

## Date Added: May 25, 2025

## Overview
Critical tasks that must be completed before production launch to ensure the application is using real data and proper content instead of mock/placeholder values.

## Data Cleanup Tasks

### üîÑ **Mock Analytics Data Removal**
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours  
**Scope**: Dashboard components throughout the application

#### Locations to Clean:
- `/src/components/dashboard/widgets/` - All analytics widgets
- `/src/components/dashboard/charts/` - Chart components with mock data
- `/services/aiSummaryService.ts` - Mock summary generation
- `/services/aiPredictionService.ts` - Mock prediction data
- `/services/mlPredictionService.ts` - Mock ML model responses
- `/services/enhancedAnalyticsService.ts` - Mock analytics calculations

#### Actions Required:
- [ ] Replace `generateMockSummary()` with real API calls
- [ ] Remove hardcoded analytics values in widgets
- [ ] Connect charts to real data sources
- [ ] Replace mock API responses with actual service calls
- [ ] Validate data accuracy and formatting

### üìù **Placeholder Content Cleanup**
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours  
**Scope**: Admin interface and user-facing content

#### Locations to Clean:
- Admin dashboard placeholder text
- Form field placeholder values
- Error message placeholders
- Navigation placeholder labels
- Help text and tooltips
- Loading state messages

#### Actions Required:
- [ ] Replace "Lorem ipsum" and placeholder text
- [ ] Update form placeholders with proper examples
- [ ] Ensure consistent tone and messaging
- [ ] Review all user-facing copy for accuracy
- [ ] Validate language consistency across components

### üìä **Hardcoded Sports Statistics Removal**
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 8-10 hours  
**Scope**: Entire codebase

#### Known Locations:
- `/services/mlPredictionService.ts` - Hardcoded reasoning templates
- Sports prediction components with fixed statistics
- Team performance data with static values
- Odds calculations with hardcoded multipliers
- Player statistics with fixed numbers

#### Actions Required:
- [ ] Audit codebase for hardcoded numerical values
- [ ] Replace static team records with API calls
- [ ] Remove hardcoded win/loss statistics
- [ ] Replace fixed odds with real-time data
- [ ] Update player statistics to use live data
- [ ] Ensure all sports data comes from verified sources

## API Integration Requirements

### üîå **Real Data Source Connections**
#### Required Integrations:
- [ ] Sports statistics API integration
- [ ] Real-time odds data feeds
- [ ] Analytics data pipeline
- [ ] User behavior tracking
- [ ] Performance monitoring APIs

### üõ°Ô∏è **Data Validation**
#### Validation Requirements:
- [ ] Verify data accuracy against known sources
- [ ] Implement data freshness checks
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for API failures
- [ ] Test edge cases with missing data
- [ ] Validate data format consistency

## Quality Assurance

### üß™ **Testing Requirements**
- [ ] Test all dashboard components with real data
- [ ] Verify analytics calculations accuracy
- [ ] Test data loading and error states
- [ ] Validate user interface with live content
- [ ] Performance testing with production data volumes

### üìä **Monitoring Setup**
- [ ] Add data quality monitoring
- [ ] Implement API failure alerting
- [ ] Monitor data freshness metrics
- [ ] Track user engagement with real content
- [ ] Set up error rate monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

### ‚úÖ **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Zero mock data remains in production code
- [ ] All placeholder content replaced with final copy
- [ ] No hardcoded sports statistics in codebase
- [ ] All data sources connected to live APIs
- [ ] Data accuracy validated against known sources
- [ ] Error handling tested for all data sources
- [ ] Performance meets requirements with real data
- [ ] User experience tested with production content

### üö® **Launch Blockers**
The following items are **LAUNCH BLOCKERS** and must be completed:
1. Mock analytics data removal (HIGH)
2. Hardcoded sports statistics removal (HIGH)
3. API integration validation (HIGH)
4. Data accuracy verification (HIGH)

### üìã **Nice to Have (Post-Launch)**
The following can be addressed after launch:
1. Placeholder content cleanup (MEDIUM)
2. UI/UX polish with final copy (LOW)
3. Advanced error handling improvements (LOW)

## Risk Assessment

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **High Risk Items**
- **Data Accuracy**: Hardcoded statistics could mislead users
- **API Dependencies**: Production systems must be stable
- **Performance**: Real data volumes may impact performance
- **User Trust**: Mock data in production damages credibility

### üõ°Ô∏è **Mitigation Strategies**
- Implement comprehensive data validation
- Add robust fallback mechanisms
- Performance test with production data volumes
- Gradual rollout to validate data accuracy
