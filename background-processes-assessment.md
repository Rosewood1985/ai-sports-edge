## Assessment Questions

### Business Impact

- **Critical Impact:** Processes 1, 4, 5, 7, 17, 19 would cause significant user-facing issues if not running
- **High Impact:** Processes 2, 3, 6, 13, 18, 20 would degrade user experience but not break core functionality
- **Medium Impact:** Processes 8, 14, 15, 21 would cause gradual degradation of system performance
- **Low Impact:** Processes 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 22, 23 would primarily affect internal operations

### Current Barriers

- **Configuration Issues:** Processes 3, 8, 13, 15, 18, 19 likely need configuration verification
- **Integration Gaps:** Processes 22, 23 have incomplete integrations
- **Technical Debt:** Processes 12, 14, 21 need modernization

- Monitoring infrastructure for admin dashboard
- CI/CD pipeline for development automation
- Error tracking service integration

### Migration Priority

1. Process 21 (offlineQueueService) - consolidate with offlineService
2. Process 12 (overnight-sync) - migrate to Firebase function
3. Process 14 (clean-database-weekly) - migrate to Firebase function

### Dashboard Scope

- **High Priority Monitoring:** All Category A processes
- **Medium Priority Monitoring:** All Category B processes
- **Environment-Specific Monitoring:** All Category C processes
- **Post-Migration Monitoring:** All Category D processes
- **No Monitoring Required:** Category E processes
