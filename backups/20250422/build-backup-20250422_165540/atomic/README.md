# Atomic Architecture

This directory follows atomic design principles to organize code in a hierarchical structure:

## Structure

- **atoms/**: Fundamental building blocks (basic UI elements, primitive functions, core utilities)
- **molecules/**: Cohesive atom groupings (simple composed components, basic service functions)
- **organisms/**: Complex components integrating molecules/atoms (complete features, service modules)
- **templates/**: Layout structures (screen layouts, data flow patterns)
- **pages/**: Specific implementations (screens, complete features)

## Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Components can be easily reused and composed
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
3. **Comprehensibility**: Intuitive organization that's easy to navigate
4. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
5. **Collaboration**: Clear boundaries for team members to work on
