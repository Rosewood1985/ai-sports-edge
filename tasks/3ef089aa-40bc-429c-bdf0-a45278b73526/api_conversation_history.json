GitHub Actions Deployment\n\nThe GitHub Actions workflow automatically deploys the application when changes are pushed to the main branch.\n\n### Setup\n\n1. In your GitHub repo, go to: Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Secrets\n2. Add a new secret:\n   - Name: `SFTP_PASS`\n   - Value: `hTQ3LQ]#P(b,`\n\n### How It Works\n\nThe workflow:\n1. Uploads the build folder via SFTP\n2. SSHs into the server and runs the fix script\n3. Verifies the deployment with a health check\n\n### Monitoring\n\nYou can monitor the deployment status in the \"Actions\" tab of your GitHub repository.\n\n## 2. Automated Script Deployment\n\nThe automated script provides a local way to deploy the application with validation and verification.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Install dependencies: `sshpass` and `lftp`\n  ```bash\n  # macOS\n  brew install sshpass lftp\n  \n  # Ubuntu/Debian\n  sudo apt-get install -y sshpass lftp\n  ```\n\n### Deployment Steps\n\n1. Run the validation script to ensure all prerequisites are met:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/validate-deployment-config.sh\n   ```\n\n2. Run the automated deployment script:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/automated-deploy-and-verify.sh\n   ```\n\n3. The script will:\n   - Validate deployment configuration\n   - Upload build folder via SFTP\n   - SSH into server and run fix script\n   - Verify deployment with health check\n\n## 3. Manual Fallback Deployment\n\nIf automated methods fail, you can use the manual fallback process.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Run the manual fallback script to create a zip file:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/manual-fallback-deploy.sh\n   ```\n\n2. Log in to GoDaddy hosting control panel\n3. Navigate to File Manager\n4. Go to `/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app`\n5. Upload `aisportsedge-deploy.zip`\n6. Extract the zip file\n7. Run the following commands in the terminal:\n   ```bash\n   cd /home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app\n   chmod -R 755 .\n   find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\n   find . -name \"*.sh\" -exec chmod +x {} \\;\n   ```\n\n8. Verify the deployment at https://aisportsedge.app\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf deployment issues occur:\n\n1. Run the detailed deployment check:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/detailed-deployment-check.sh\n   ```\n\n2. Check for common issues:\n   - SFTP credentials incorrect\n   - File permissions not set correctly\n   - .htaccess file missing or incorrect\n   - Build files not in the correct location\n\n3. If needed, SSH into the server and run the fix script manually:\n   ```bash\n   ssh deploy@aisportsedge.app\n   cd /home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app\n   chmod +x fix-permissions-and-build.sh\n   ./fix-permissions-and-build.sh\n   ```\n\n## Deployment Configuration\n\nThe deployment configuration is stored in:\n- `.vscode/sftp.json` (symlink to `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json`)\n\nKey configuration values:\n- Host: `aisportsedge.app`\n- Username: `deploy@aisportsedge.app`\n- Remote Path: `/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app`\n</content>\n<line_count>118</line_count>\n</write_to_file>"}],"ts":1745432661153},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"[write_to_file for 'docs/deployment-guide.md'] Result:"},{"type":"text","text":"The content was successfully saved to docs/deployment-guide.md."},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\ndocs/deployment-guide.md\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\ncommit-message-automated-deployment.txt,scripts/push-automated-deployment.sh,scripts/validate-deployment-config.sh,scripts/automated-deploy-and-verify.sh,commit-message-deployment-validator.txt,scripts/push-deployment-validator.sh,scripts/manual-fallback-deploy.sh,commit-message-manual-fallback.txt,scripts/push-manual-fallback.sh,.github/workflows/deploy-to-godaddy.yml,commit-message-github-actions.txt,scripts/push-github-actions.sh,docs/deployment-guide.md\n\n# Actively Running Terminals\n## Original command: `./scripts/deploy-build-sftp.sh`\n## Original command: `./scripts/automated-deploy-and-verify.sh`\n\n# Current Time\n4/23/2025, 2:24:38 PM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\n\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\n109,227 (55%)\n\n# Current Cost\n$7.30\n\n# Current Mode\n<slug>boomerang-mode</slug>\n<name>Boomerang Mode</name>\n<model>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</model>\n<role>You are operating in Boomerang Mode for the AI Sports Edge project.

You function like a senior developer embedded in the repo, focused on clarity, efficiency, and logic preservation.\n\nYour responsibilities include:\n\nRefactoring code using atomic architecture, returning snippets that can be dropped in with minimal editing.\n\nConfirming that existing logic is preserved unless explicitly asked to redesign.\n\nFlagging performance bottlenecks, edge cases, or non-idiomatic usage patterns.\n\nReviewing and iterating quickly with minimal hand-holding, using concise language and assertive decisions.\n\nReturning fixes that are clean, fast, and easy to test.\n\nYou are a sharp, tactical code reviewer who supports high-velocity development with clarity and confidence.</role>\n<custom_instructions>\n====\n\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.\n\nLanguage Preference:\nYou should always speak and think in the \"English\" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\n\nGlobal Instructions:\nYou are assisting with the development of AI Sports Edge, a React Native (Expo) app using atomic architecture. The codebase lives in VS Code, follows a modular design, and is managed in a private GitHub repo. Prettier is used for formatting. Firebase and Stripe are integrated, and the app is deployed via SFTP to GoDaddy (aisportsedge.app).\n\nYour responsibilities include:\n\nüìê Code Architecture\n\nBuild and refactor components following atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms).\n\nMaintain clean, modular, and scalable folder structures.\n\nAuto-format with Prettier unless directed otherwise.\n\nüßπ Code Quality\n\nEliminate dead code, redundant imports, and logic bloat.\n\nWatch for performance hits, logic gaps, or layout inconsistencies.\n\nPreserve logic from previous iterations unless redesigning is requested.\n\nüìã Workflow Support\n\nTrack ongoing to-do list updates based on code changes or new issues.\n\nSupport Git workflows: staging, branching, commit writing, and resolving merge conflicts.\n\nüåç Spanish Language Support\n\nTranslate UI labels, notifications, and region-specific elements (e.g., decimal odds).\n\nSupport English ‚Üî Spanish toggling and auto-detection logic.\n\nEnsure Spanish versions are stylistically consistent.\n\nüöÄ Deployment\n\nHelp prep builds and deploy via SFTP.\n\nTroubleshoot 500 errors, CSP/meta tag issues, Firebase env loading, and .htaccess conflicts.\n\nRecommend GitHub Actions pipelines or equivalent automation.\n\nEnsure SEO best practices (meta tags, sitemap, page load optimization) are followed.\n\nü§ù Collaboration Style\n\nOperate like an embedded AI dev on the team‚Äîfast, accurate, and low-friction.\n\nUse code blocks, file paths, and bullet points to enhance clarity.\n\nFlag anything that needs comments, documentation, or architectural alignment.\n\nMode-specific Instructions:\nBoomerang Mode is optimized for rapid iteration on the AI Sports Edge app. This includes Firebase (auth, Firestore, config), React Native (Expo), Stripe integration, and betting-specific logic.\n\nBehavioral Guidelines:\n\nüîß Fix Firebase auth, Firestore read/write, or config errors instantly. Don‚Äôt wait for permission.\n\nüí≥ If Stripe errors occur, suggest testing credentials or checking logs right away.\n\nüîÅ Always preserve existing logic unless a redesign is requested.\n\nüé® When adjusting UI/UX, propose minimal styling updates using Tailwind/React Native that won‚Äôt break layout flow.\n\nüß† After any bug fix, include one short sentence explaining why the fix works.\n\nüß™ After each patch, ask: ‚ÄúWant this deployed?‚Äù\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è If a config or path is clearly broken, go ahead and patch it, then explain.\n\nTone:\n\nDirect, concise, and focused like a senior dev mid-sprint.\n\nUse punchy headers and bullets for explanations.\n\nDon‚Äôt overexplain‚Äîbe surgical and clear.</custom_instructions>\n\n\n# Current Workspace Directory
