Access to the Firebase project\\n-5. Access to the Expo account\\n-6. Access to the GitHub repository\\n+1. **GitHub Actions (Recommended)** - Automated CI/CD pipeline triggered on push to main\\n+2. **Automated Script** - Local script that handles validation, upload, and verification\\n+3. **Manual Fallback** - Step-by-step process for manual deployment via GoDaddy control panel\\n \\n-## Deployment Scripts\\n+## 1. GitHub Actions Deployment\\n \\n-We've created three deployment scripts to simplify the deployment process:\\n+The GitHub Actions workflow automatically deploys the application when changes are pushed to the main branch.\\n \\n-1. `scripts/deploy-web.sh` - Deploys the web app to Firebase hosting\\n-2. `scripts/deploy-ios.sh` - Builds and submits the iOS app to the App Store\\n-3. `scripts/push-to-github.sh` - Commits and pushes changes to GitHub\\n+### Setup\\n \\n-## Web Deployment Process\\n+1. In your GitHub repo, go to: Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Secrets\\n+2. Add a new secret:\\n+   - Name: `SFTP_PASS`\\n+   - Value: `hTQ3LQ]#P(b,`\\n \\n-The web deployment process involves the following steps:\\n+### How It Works\\n \\n-1. Build the web app\\n-2. Verify Firebase configuration\\n-3. Check for Spanish version\\n-4. Deploy to Firebase hosting\\n+The workflow:\\n+1. Uploads the build folder via SFTP\\n+2. SSHs into the server and runs the fix script\\n+3. Verifies the deployment with a health check\\n \\n-### Running the Web Deployment Script\\n+### Monitoring\\n \\n-```bash\\n-./scripts/deploy-web.sh\\n-```\\n+You can monitor the deployment status in the \\\"Actions\\\" tab of your GitHub repository.\\n \\n-This script will:\\n-- Check if Firebase CLI is installed and you're logged in\\n-- Build the web app\\n-- Verify Firebase configuration\\n-- Check for Spanish version\\n-- Deploy to Firebase hosting\\n-- Verify deployment\\n+## 2. Automated Script Deployment\\n \\n-### Firebase Hosting Configuration\\n+The automated script provides a local way to deploy the application with validation and verification.\\n \\n-The web app is deployed to two Firebase hosting sites:\\n-- Default site: `ai-sports-edge.web.app`\\n-- Custom domain: `aisportsedge-app.web.app`\\n+### Prerequisites\\n \\n-The configuration for these sites is in `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc`.\\n+- Install dependencies: `sshpass` and `lftp`\\n+  ```bash\\n+  # macOS\\n+  brew install sshpass lftp\\n+  \\n+  # Ubuntu/Debian\\n+  sudo apt-get install -y sshpass lftp\\n+  ```\\n \\n-## iOS Deployment Process\\n+### Deployment Steps\\n \\n-The iOS deployment process involves the following steps:\\n+1. Run the validation script to ensure all prerequisites are met:\\n+   ```bash\\n+   ./scripts/validate-deployment-config.sh\\n+   ```\\n \\n-1. Update app version\\n-2. Check for Spanish localization\\n-3. Build the app using EAS\\n-4. Submit to App Store Connect (for TestFlight or Production)\\n+2. Run the automated deployment script:\\n+   ```bash\\n+   ./scripts/automated-deploy-and-verify.sh\\n+   ```\\n \\n-### Running the iOS Deployment Script\\n+3. The script will:\\n+   - Validate deployment configuration\\n+   - Upload build folder via SFTP\\n+   - SSH into server and run fix script\\n+   - Verify deployment with health check\\n \\n-```bash\\n-./scripts/deploy-ios.sh\\n-```\\n+## 3. Manual Fallback Deployment\\n \\n-This script will:\\n-- Check if Expo CLI and EAS CLI are installed and you're logged in\\n-- Prompt for a new version number\\n-- Check for Spanish localization\\n-- Prompt for build type (Preview, Internal, TestFlight, or Production)\\n-- Build the app using EAS\\n-- Submit to App Store Connect (for TestFlight or Production)\\n+If automated methods fail, you can use the manual fallback process.\\n \\n-### EAS Build Profiles\\n+### Steps\\n \\n-The EAS build profiles are defined in `eas.json`:\\n-- `preview` - For development testing\\n-- `internal` - For internal testing\\n-- `testflight` - For TestFlight distribution\\n-- `production` - For App Store distribution\\n+1. Run the manual fallback script to create a zip file:\\n+   ```bash\\n+   ./scripts/manual-fallback-deploy.sh\\n+   ```\\n \\n-## GitHub Workflow\\n+2. Log in to GoDaddy hosting control panel\\n+3. Navigate to File Manager\\n+4. Go to `/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app`\\n+5. Upload `aisportsedge-deploy.zip`\\n+6. Extract the zip file\\n+7. Run the following commands in the terminal:\\n+   ```bash\\n+   cd /home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app\\n+   chmod -R 755 .\\n+   find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\\\;\\n+   find . -name \\\"*.sh\\\" -exec chmod +x {} \\\\;\\n+   ```\\n \\n-To push changes to GitHub:\\n+8. Verify the deployment at https://aisportsedge.app\\n \\n-```bash\\n\\\\ No newline at end of file\\n-./scripts/push-to-github.sh\\n-```\\n-\\n-This script will:\\n-- Show changes to be committed\\n-- Prompt for a commit message\\n-- Add and commit changes\\n-- Push to the remote repository\\n-\\n-## Internationalization\\n-\\n-The app supports both English and Spanish languages:\\n-\\n-- Web: Spanish version is available at `/es/` path\\n-- iOS: Spanish localization is in `ios/AISportsEdge/Supporting/es.lproj/`\\n-\\n ## Troubleshooting\\n \\n-### Web Deployment Issues\\n+If deployment issues occur:\\n \\n-1. **Firebase Configuration Missing**\\n-   - Check if `public/firebase-config.js` exists\\n-   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly\\n+1. Run the detailed deployment check:\\n+   ```bash\\n+   ./scripts/detailed-deployment-check.sh\\n+   ```\\n \\n-2. **Spanish Version Missing**\\n-   - Check if `public/es/index.html` exists\\n-   - Ensure language tag is set to `es`\\n+2. Check for common issues:\\n+   - SFTP credentials incorrect\\n+   - File permissions not set correctly\\n+   - .htaccess file missing or incorrect\\n+   - Build files not in the correct location\\n \\n-### iOS Deployment Issues\\n+3. If needed, SSH into the server and run the fix script manually:\\n+   ```bash\\n+   ssh deploy@aisportsedge.app\\n+   cd /home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app\\n+   chmod +x fix-permissions-and-build.sh\\n+   ./fix-permissions-and-build.sh\\n+   ```\\n \\n-1. **EAS Build Fails**\\n-   - Check EAS build logs\\n-   - Ensure all dependencies are installed\\n-   - Verify app.json configuration\\n+## Deployment Configuration\\n \\n-2. **Spanish Localization Missing**\\n-   - Check if `ios/AISportsEdge/Supporting/es.lproj/` exists\\n-   - Ensure InfoPlist.strings is properly translated\\n+The deployment configuration is stored in:\\n+- `.vscode/sftp.json` (symlink to `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json`)\\n \\n-## Post-Deployment Verification\\n-\\n-After deployment, verify the following:\\n-\\n-1. **Web App**\\n-   - Visit both hosting sites\\n-   - Test Spanish version\\n-   - Verify Firebase authentication\\n-   - Test core functionality\\n-\\n-2. **iOS App**\\n-   - Install from TestFlight or App Store\\n-   - Test Spanish localization\\n-   - Verify push notifications\\n-   - Test core functionality\\n-\\n-## Rollback Procedure\\n-\\n-If issues are found after deployment:\\n-\\n-1. **Web App**\\n-   - Use Firebase hosting rollback: `firebase hosting:rollback`\\n-\\n-2. **iOS App**\\n-   - For TestFlight: Stop testing the current build\\n-   - For Production: Submit a new build with fixes\\n+Key configuration values:\\n+- Host: `aisportsedge.app`\\n+- Username: `deploy@aisportsedge.app`\\n+- Remote Path: `/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app`\\n\\\\ No newline at end of file\\n\"}","partial":false},{"ts":1745432662676,"type":"say","say":"checkpoint_saved","text":"d7a973d576d80217d3abbfdd99c12d107c553fcf","checkpoint":{"isFirst":false,"from":"ac5f49130b8016b9ab2fb41434a6a90b84c664ac","to":"d7a973d576d80217d3abbfdd99c12d107c553fcf"}},{"ts":1745432662677,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"request\":\"[write_to_file for 'docs/deployment-guide.md'] Result:\\n\\nThe content was successfully saved to docs/deployment-guide.md.\\n\\n<environment_details>\\n# VSCode Visible Files\\ndocs/deployment-guide.md\\n\\n# VSCode Open Tabs\\ncommit-message-automated-deployment.txt,scripts/push-automated-deployment.sh,scripts/validate-deployment-config.sh,scripts/automated-deploy-and-verify.sh,commit-message-deployment-validator.txt,scripts/push-deployment-validator.sh,scripts/manual-fallback-deploy.sh,commit-message-manual-fallback.txt,scripts/push-manual-fallback.sh,.github/workflows/deploy-to-godaddy.yml,commit-message-github-actions.txt,scripts/push-github-actions.sh,docs/deployment-guide.md\\n\\n# Actively Running Terminals\\n## Original command: `./scripts/deploy-build-sftp.sh`\\n## Original command: `./scripts/automated-deploy-and-verify.sh`\\n\\n# Current Time\\n4/23/2025, 2:24:38 PM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\\n\\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\\n109,227 (55%)\\n\\n# Current Cost\\n$7.30\\n\\n# Current Mode\\n<slug>boomerang-mode</slug>\\n<name>Boomerang Mode</name>\\n<model>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</model>\\n<role>You are operating in Boomerang Mode for the AI Sports Edge project.
