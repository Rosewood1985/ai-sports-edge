This is part of a larger workspace validation task.\n\n## Context\n- The project is located at: `/Users/lisadario/Desktop/ai-sports-edge`\n- Previous steps have confirmed that all required directories exist, Git is properly initialized, and the Node.js environment is valid\n- Firebase config should be located at `/src/config/firebaseConfig.ts` or similar\n\n## Your Task\n1. Locate and examine the Firebase configuration file(s)\n2. Verify that:\n   - The config file exists\n   - It uses the real ai-sports-edge-final Firebase keys (not placeholder values)\n   - No placeholder values (e.g., XXXXX) remain\n   - The storageBucket is set to: ai-sports-edge-final.appspot.com\n\nPlease only perform the work outlined in these instructions and do not deviate. When complete, use the `attempt_completion` tool with a concise summary of your findings in the `result` parameter.

Let me summarize my findings:\n\n1. In the src/config/ directory:\n   - firebase.ts and firebase.js both have hardcoded Firebase configuration with storageBucket set to \"ai-sports-edge-final.appspot.com\"\n   - These files are used for direct Firebase initialization in the web/JavaScript part of the application\n\n2. In the atomic architecture:\n   - The Firebase configuration is loaded from environment variables\n   - The .env files (.env.development, .env.production) have FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET set to \"ai-sports-edge.appspot.com\"\n   - This creates a potential inconsistency if the atomic architecture is used\n\n3. For native platforms:\n   - iOS: firebase-config/GoogleService-Info.plist has STORAGE_BUCKET set to \"ai-sports-edge.appspot.com\"\n   - Android: firebase-config/google-services.json has storage_bucket set to \"ai-sports-edge.appspot.com\"\n\nThere's a discrepancy between the hardcoded web configuration (ai-sports-edge-final.appspot.com) and the native platform configurations (ai-sports-edge.appspot.com).\n\nAccording to the task requirements, I need to verify that:\n- The config file exists: ‚úÖ Yes, multiple config files exist\n- It uses the real ai-sports-edge-final Firebase keys: ‚úÖ Yes, the web config files use these keys\n- No placeholder values remain: ‚úÖ Yes, all values are filled with actual keys/IDs\n- The storageBucket is set to: ai-sports-edge-final.appspot.com: ‚ùå Only in the web config files, not in the native platform configs or environment variables\n\nThis discrepancy could potentially cause issues when the app tries to access Firebase Storage from different platforms. Let me prepare a summary of my findings.\n</thinking>\n\n<attempt_completion>\n<result>\n# Firebase Configuration Verification Results\n\nI've examined all Firebase configuration files in the project and found the following:\n\n## Web Configuration (‚úÖ Correct)\n- Files: `src/config/firebase.ts` and `src/config/firebase.js`\n- Status: **VALID**\n- Contains real Firebase keys for `ai-sports-edge-final` project\n- Storage bucket correctly set to `ai-sports-edge-final.appspot.com`\n- No placeholder values present\n\n## Native Platform Configuration (‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent)\n- iOS: `firebase-config/GoogleService-Info.plist`\n- Android: `firebase-config/google-services.json`\n- Both files reference a different project: `ai-sports-edge` (not final)\n- Storage bucket set to `ai-sports-edge.appspot.com`\n\n## Environment Variables (‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent)\n- `.env.development` and `.env.production` files\n- Reference the non-final project: `ai-sports-edge`\n- Storage bucket set to `ai-sports-edge.appspot.com`\n\n## Atomic Architecture (‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issue)\n- Uses environment variables via `getEnvVar()` function\n- Will inherit the inconsistent storage bucket value\n\n**Summary:** The web configuration is correctly set up with the required `ai-sports-edge-final.appspot.com` storage bucket, but native platform configurations and environment variables reference a different project. This inconsistency could cause cross-platform issues when accessing Firebase Storage.\n</result>\n</attempt_completion>"}],"ts":1745812786918}]
