Here's a summary of the findings:\n\nThe primary web build for the \"ai sports edge app\" is integrated within the main Expo project and utilizes `react-native-web`. The source code for this web version resides in the `web/` directory.\n\nAccording to the `package.json`, the build process is handled by the command `expo export --platform web`, which typically outputs files to a `web-build/` directory.\n\nDeployment is configured via `firebase.json` to use Firebase Hosting. This configuration expects the built web assets to be located in a `dist/` directory.\n\nThere is also a separate static website located in the `aisportsedge-deploy/` directory, which appears distinct from the main Expo-based web build.\n\n**Current Status:** The project is set up to build a web version using Expo and deploy it via Firebase Hosting. However, there seems to be a missing step in the defined configuration: the process to move or copy the build output from Expo's default `web-build/` directory to the `dist/` directory required by the Firebase Hosting configuration is not explicitly defined in the files examined (`package.json`, `firebase.json`). This means the current Firebase deployment configuration might not work without an additional step or script to handle this file movement after the `expo export` command runs.\n\n<attempt_completion>\n<result>\nBased on the investigation:\n1.  The main web build uses Expo (`react-native-web`) with source code in `web/`.\n2.  It's built via `expo export --platform web`.\n3.  Deployment is configured for Firebase Hosting, targeting a `dist/` directory.\n4.  The `aisportsedge-deploy/` directory contains a separate static site.\n5.  **Status:** The setup is mostly complete, but there's a likely gap in the process: moving the build output from Expo's default `web-build/` folder to the `dist/` folder required by the Firebase deployment configuration isn't explicitly defined.\n</result>\n</attempt_completion>"}],"ts":1744766981989}]
