Run `git status` to verify that Git is initialized and active in the project\n2. Check if there are any uncommitted changes or if the repository is clean\n3. Verify that the Git repository is properly configured (check remote repositories if possible)\n\nPlease only perform the work outlined in these instructions and do not deviate.

When all subtasks are completed, synthesize the results and provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished.\n\n6.

I now have comprehensive information about the Git configuration. Let me summarize what I've learned:\n\n1. Git is properly initialized and active in the project\n2. The repository is on the `main` branch, which is up to date with the remote repository\n3. The remote repository is configured as \"origin\" pointing to https://github.com/Rosewood1985/ai-sports-edge.git\n4. User configuration is set up with name \"Rosewood1985\" and email \"ai.sportsedgeapp@gmail.com\"\n5. There are several branches configured:\n   - main\n   - feature/fanduel-affiliate-integration\n   - phase1-implementation\n   - feature/atomic-architecture-20250422_152356\n6. There are some uncommitted changes in the working directory (modified files in cache and tasks directories)\n7. There are some untracked files (new task directories)\n\nThis confirms that Git is properly initialized and configured in the project. I have all the information needed to complete the verification task.\n\nLet me now use the attempt_completion tool to provide a summary of my findings.\n</thinking>\n\nNow I have all the information needed to verify the Git initialization and configuration. Let me summarize my findings:\n\n<attempt_completion>\n<result>\nGit Verification Results:\n\n1.
