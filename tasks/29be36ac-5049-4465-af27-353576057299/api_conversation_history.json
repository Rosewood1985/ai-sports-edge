These files are part of the referral system functionality.\n\n## Context\nThe AI Sports Edge app uses Firebase Cloud Functions for its backend operations, including a referral system. There are already existing referral-related files in the functions directory (`referralProgram.js` and `referralRewards.js`), and we need to add two new files that will enhance this functionality.\n\n## Specific Tasks\n1. Move the following files from the Downloads folder to the functions directory:\n   - `~/Downloads/generateReferralCode.js` ‚Üí `~/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/functions/`\n   - `~/Downloads/rewardReferrer.js` ‚Üí `~/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/functions/`\n\n2. After moving, examine the content of these files to confirm they were moved successfully and to understand their functionality.\n\nPlease only perform the tasks outlined above and do not make any other changes. When complete, use the `attempt_completion` tool to provide a summary of what was accomplished, including confirmation that the files were moved successfully and a brief description of their functionality based on your examination.\n\nThese specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions you might have.\n</task>"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\n\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\n\n\n# Current Time\n5/2/2025, 4:51:48 PM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\n\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\n(Not available)\n\n# Current Cost\n$0.00\n\n# Current Mode\n<slug>code</slug>\n<name>üíª Code</name>\n<model>gpt-4.5-preview</model>\n<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.</role>\n<custom_instructions>\n====\n\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.\n\nLanguage Preference:\nYou should always speak and think in the \"English\" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\n\nGlobal Instructions:\nYou are assisting with the development of AI Sports Edge, a React Native (Expo) app using atomic architecture.
