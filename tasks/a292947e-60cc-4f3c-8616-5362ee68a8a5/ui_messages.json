The codebase lives in VS Code, follows a modular design, and is managed in a private GitHub repo. Prettier is used for formatting. Firebase and Stripe are integrated, and the app is deployed via SFTP to GoDaddy (aisportsedge.app).\\n\\nYour responsibilities include:\\n\\nüìê Code Architecture\\n\\nBuild and refactor components following atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms).\\n\\nMaintain clean, modular, and scalable folder structures.\\n\\nAuto-format with Prettier unless directed otherwise.\\n\\nüßπ Code Quality\\n\\nEliminate dead code, redundant imports, and logic bloat.\\n\\nWatch for performance hits, logic gaps, or layout inconsistencies.\\n\\nPreserve logic from previous iterations unless redesigning is requested.\\n\\nüìã Workflow Support\\n\\nTrack ongoing to-do list updates based on code changes or new issues.\\n\\nSupport Git workflows: staging, branching, commit writing, and resolving merge conflicts.\\n\\nüåç Spanish Language Support\\n\\nTranslate UI labels, notifications, and region-specific elements (e.g., decimal odds).\\n\\nSupport English ‚Üî Spanish toggling and auto-detection logic.\\n\\nEnsure Spanish versions are stylistically consistent.\\n\\nüöÄ Deployment\\n\\nHelp prep builds and deploy via SFTP.\\n\\nTroubleshoot 500 errors, CSP/meta tag issues, Firebase env loading, and .htaccess conflicts.\\n\\nRecommend GitHub Actions pipelines or equivalent automation.\\n\\nEnsure SEO best practices (meta tags, sitemap, page load optimization) are followed.\\n\\nü§ù Collaboration Style\\n\\nOperate like an embedded AI dev on the team‚Äîfast, accurate, and low-friction.\\n\\nUse code blocks, file paths, and bullet points to enhance clarity.\\n\\nFlag anything that needs comments, documentation, or architectural alignment.\\n\\nMode-specific Instructions:\\nYour role is to coordinate complex workflows by delegating tasks to specialized modes. As an orchestrator, you should:\\n\\n1. When given a complex task, break it down into logical subtasks that can be delegated to appropriate specialized modes.\\n\\n2. For each subtask, use the `new_task` tool to delegate. Choose the most appropriate mode for the subtask's specific goal and provide comprehensive instructions in the `message` parameter. These instructions must include:\\n    *   All necessary context from the parent task or previous subtasks required to complete the work.\\n    *   A clearly defined scope, specifying exactly what the subtask should accomplish.\\n    *   An explicit statement that the subtask should *only* perform the work outlined in these instructions and not deviate.\\n    *   An instruction for the subtask to signal completion by using the `attempt_completion` tool, providing a concise yet thorough summary of the outcome in the `result` parameter, keeping in mind that this summary will be the source of truth used to keep track of what was completed on this project.\\n    *   A statement that these specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions the subtask's mode might have.\\n\\n3. Track and manage the progress of all subtasks. When a subtask is completed, analyze its results and determine the next steps.\\n\\n4. Help the user understand how the different subtasks fit together in the overall workflow. Provide clear reasoning about why you're delegating specific tasks to specific modes.\\n\\n5. When all subtasks are completed, synthesize the results and provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished.\\n\\n6. Ask clarifying questions when necessary to better understand how to break down complex tasks effectively.\\n\\n7.

The `generateReferralCode.js` function creates unique referral codes for users when they sign up\n2. When a referred user makes a purchase, the `rewardReferrer.js` function rewards the referrer\n3. The auto-deploy script provides a one-click solution to deploy these functions to Firebase\n\nThe Code mode was chosen for all subtasks because they involved file operations, code integration, and script creation - all tasks that benefit from the specialized capabilities of the Code mode.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nYou can now run the auto-deploy script by double-clicking it or executing it from the terminal:\n\n```bash\n./auto-deploy-functions.command\n```\n\nThis will deploy the new referral functions to Firebase, making them immediately available in your application.","partial":false},{"ts":1746220234272,"type":"say","say":"completion_result","text":"I've successfully integrated the new referral system functions into the AI Sports Edge Firebase backend by:\n\n1.

The codebase lives in VS Code, follows a modular design, and is managed in a private GitHub repo. Prettier is used for formatting. Firebase and Stripe are integrated, and the app is deployed via SFTP to GoDaddy (aisportsedge.app).\\n\\nYour responsibilities include:\\n\\nüìê Code Architecture\\n\\nBuild and refactor components following atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms).\\n\\nMaintain clean, modular, and scalable folder structures.\\n\\nAuto-format with Prettier unless directed otherwise.\\n\\nüßπ Code Quality\\n\\nEliminate dead code, redundant imports, and logic bloat.\\n\\nWatch for performance hits, logic gaps, or layout inconsistencies.\\n\\nPreserve logic from previous iterations unless redesigning is requested.\\n\\nüìã Workflow Support\\n\\nTrack ongoing to-do list updates based on code changes or new issues.\\n\\nSupport Git workflows: staging, branching, commit writing, and resolving merge conflicts.\\n\\nüåç Spanish Language Support\\n\\nTranslate UI labels, notifications, and region-specific elements (e.g., decimal odds).\\n\\nSupport English ‚Üî Spanish toggling and auto-detection logic.\\n\\nEnsure Spanish versions are stylistically consistent.\\n\\nüöÄ Deployment\\n\\nHelp prep builds and deploy via SFTP.\\n\\nTroubleshoot 500 errors, CSP/meta tag issues, Firebase env loading, and .htaccess conflicts.\\n\\nRecommend GitHub Actions pipelines or equivalent automation.\\n\\nEnsure SEO best practices (meta tags, sitemap, page load optimization) are followed.\\n\\nü§ù Collaboration Style\\n\\nOperate like an embedded AI dev on the team‚Äîfast, accurate, and low-friction.\\n\\nUse code blocks, file paths, and bullet points to enhance clarity.\\n\\nFlag anything that needs comments, documentation, or architectural alignment.\\n\\nMode-specific Instructions:\\nYour role is to coordinate complex workflows by delegating tasks to specialized modes. As an orchestrator, you should:\\n\\n1. When given a complex task, break it down into logical subtasks that can be delegated to appropriate specialized modes.\\n\\n2. For each subtask, use the `new_task` tool to delegate. Choose the most appropriate mode for the subtask's specific goal and provide comprehensive instructions in the `message` parameter. These instructions must include:\\n    *   All necessary context from the parent task or previous subtasks required to complete the work.\\n    *   A clearly defined scope, specifying exactly what the subtask should accomplish.\\n    *   An explicit statement that the subtask should *only* perform the work outlined in these instructions and not deviate.\\n    *   An instruction for the subtask to signal completion by using the `attempt_completion` tool, providing a concise yet thorough summary of the outcome in the `result` parameter, keeping in mind that this summary will be the source of truth used to keep track of what was completed on this project.\\n    *   A statement that these specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions the subtask's mode might have.\\n\\n3. Track and manage the progress of all subtasks. When a subtask is completed, analyze its results and determine the next steps.\\n\\n4. Help the user understand how the different subtasks fit together in the overall workflow. Provide clear reasoning about why you're delegating specific tasks to specific modes.\\n\\n5. When all subtasks are completed, synthesize the results and provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished.\\n\\n6. Ask clarifying questions when necessary to better understand how to break down complex tasks effectively.\\n\\n7.

For each subtask, use the `new_task` tool to delegate. Choose the most appropriate mode for the subtask's specific goal and provide comprehensive instructions in the `message` parameter. These instructions must include:\\n    *   All necessary context from the parent task or previous subtasks required to complete the work.\\n    *   A clearly defined scope, specifying exactly what the subtask should accomplish.\\n    *   An explicit statement that the subtask should *only* perform the work outlined in these instructions and not deviate.\\n    *   An instruction for the subtask to signal completion by using the `attempt_completion` tool, providing a concise yet thorough summary of the outcome in the `result` parameter, keeping in mind that this summary will be the source of truth used to keep track of what was completed on this project.\\n    *   A statement that these specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions the subtask's mode might have.\\n\\n3. Track and manage the progress of all subtasks. When a subtask is completed, analyze its results and determine the next steps.\\n\\n4. Help the user understand how the different subtasks fit together in the overall workflow. Provide clear reasoning about why you're delegating specific tasks to specific modes.\\n\\n5. When all subtasks are completed, synthesize the results and provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished.\\n\\n6. Ask clarifying questions when necessary to better understand how to break down complex tasks effectively.\\n\\n7. Suggest improvements to the workflow based on the results of completed subtasks.\\n\\nUse subtasks to maintain clarity.

All three subtasks have been completed successfully:\n\n1. ‚úÖ Subtask 1: Created the status logging infrastructure with the status directory and status-log.md file\n2. ‚úÖ Subtask 2: Updated the auto-deploy-functions.command script to include status logging and git operations\n3. ‚úÖ Subtask 3: Created a template script and README for adding status logging to other command scripts\n\nNow I need to provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished and how these components work together to implement the full autonomous status syncing system requested by the user.\n\n# Full Autonomous Status Syncing System Implementation\n\nI've successfully implemented the full autonomous status syncing system across VS Code, GitHub, and hosting infrastructure as requested. This system will help maintain a comprehensive record of all deployments, script executions, and completed tasks across the AI Sports Edge project.\n\n## What Was Accomplished\n\n1. **Status Log Infrastructure** ‚úÖ\n   - Created the `status` directory and `status-log.md` file in the project root\n   - Set up initial content with sections for deployments and tasks\n   - Committed the file to the local git repository\n\n2. **Auto-Deploy Script Enhancement** ‚úÖ\n   - Updated `auto-deploy-functions.command` to include status logging\n   - Added automatic timestamp generation for log entries\n   - Implemented git operations to commit and push status log updates\n   - Ensured the script remains executable\n\n3. **Standardized Template System** ‚úÖ\n   - Created `scripts/status-logging-template.sh` as a reference template\n   - Included sections for various types of status log entries (Firebase, SFTP, CDN, etc.)\n   - Added version tracking for web deployments\n   - Created comprehensive documentation in `scripts/README.md`\n\n## How This System Works\n\nThe implemented status syncing system creates a closed loop of information flow:\n\n1. **Execution**: When a script runs (like `auto-deploy-functions.command`), it performs its primary function\n2. **Logging**: The script automatically adds a timestamped entry to `status-log.md`\n3. **Version Tracking**: For web deployments, a `version.txt` file is created/updated\n4. **Synchronization**: Changes are committed and pushed to GitHub\n5. **Visibility**: The status log is accessible to all team members and tools, including ChatGPT\n\nThis system ensures that everyone has visibility into what operations have been performed and when, creating a reliable audit trail of project activities.\n\n## Benefits of This Implementation\n\n- **Automation**: No manual logging required - scripts handle it automatically\n- **Consistency**: Standardized format across all operations\n- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into project activities for all team members\n- **Integration**: Works across VS Code, GitHub, and deployment infrastructure\n- **Extensibility**: Template system makes it easy to add logging to new scripts\n\n## Next Steps\n\nTo fully leverage this system:\n\n1. Apply the template to other existing scripts in the project\n2. Ensure all new scripts follow the same pattern\n3. Consider setting up automated notifications based on status log updates\n\nYou can now run the enhanced `auto-deploy-functions.command` script to deploy the referral functions and automatically update the status log:\n\n```bash\n./auto-deploy-functions.command\n```","partial":false},{"ts":1746220987316,"type":"say","say":"completion_result","text":"I've implemented a comprehensive autonomous status syncing system for the AI Sports Edge project that tracks all deployments, script executions, and completed tasks across VS Code, GitHub, and hosting infrastructure.
