It has been updated to include a navigation link to the signup page.\n\n2. login.html - This is the login page that has been updated to include a link to the signup page. It uses Firebase authentication for user login.\n\n3. signup.html - This is a new page that allows users to create an account using Firebase authentication. It includes a password strength meter and validation.\n\nThe README.md file mentioned that these files need to be deployed using the VS Code SFTP extension. The SFTP configuration is in the `.vscode/sftp.json` file, which I've already examined.\n\nLet me provide a comprehensive overview of the project and deployment instructions.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on my examination of the files, I can provide you with a comprehensive overview of the AI Sports Edge project and the deployment process:\n\n## Project Overview\n\nThis is a web application called \"AI Sports Edge\" focused on AI-powered sports betting predictions. The project consists of three main HTML files that need to be deployed:\n\n1. **index.html** - The main landing page featuring:\n   - Detailed meta tags for SEO and security\n   - Structured data for search engines\n   - Firebase integration\n   - Sections for features, sports coverage, and betting functionality\n   - Navigation links to other pages\n\n2. **login.html** - The login page that has been updated with:\n   - Firebase authentication integration\n   - Form for user login\n   - Password reset functionality\n   - Link to the signup page\n   - Styled with a neon UI theme\n\n3. **signup.html** - A new page with:\n   - Firebase authentication for account creation\n   - Password strength meter\n   - Form validation\n   - Link back to the login page\n   - Consistent styling with the rest of the site\n\n## Firebase Integration\n\nAll three pages use Firebase for authentication:\n- The login page allows users to sign in with email/password\n- The signup page allows users to create new accounts\n- Both pages include error handling and user-friendly messages\n- Firebase configuration is included in each file\n\n## Deployment Process\n\nAccording to the README and the SFTP configuration, these files need to be deployed to a web server using the VS Code SFTP extension. Here's the deployment setup:\n\n- **Server**: p3plzcpnl508920.prod.phx3.secureserver.net (GoDaddy hosting)\n- **Protocol**: FTP (port 21)\n- **Username**: q15133yvmhnq\n- **Remote Path**: /home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html\n- **Upload on Save**: Enabled (files will automatically upload when saved)\n\n## Deployment Steps\n\n1. Install the VS Code SFTP extension by Natizyskunk if not already installed\n2. The SFTP configuration is already set up in `.vscode/sftp.json`\n3. To deploy the files:\n   - Right-click on each file in the Explorer\n   - Select \"SFTP: Upload\"\n   - Or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+U (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Alt+U (Mac)\n4. After deployment, verify by visiting:\n   - https://aisportsedge.app/signup.html\n   - https://aisportsedge.app/login.html\n   - https://aisportsedge.app/index.html\n\n## Key Changes in This Deployment\n\n1. **New signup.html page** with Firebase authentication\n2. **Updated login.html** with a link to the signup page\n3. **Updated index.html** with navigation link to the signup page\n\nThe deployment is straightforward using the VS Code SFTP extension, which is already configured to connect to the GoDaddy hosting server."}],"ts":1744949171828},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"[ERROR] You did not use a tool in your previous response!

Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_name>\n<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>\n<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>\n...\n</tool_name>\n\nFor example:\n\n<attempt_completion>\n<result>\nI have completed the task...\n</result>\n</attempt_completion>\n\nAlways adhere to this format for all tool uses to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf you have completed the user's task, use the attempt_completion tool. \nIf you require additional information from the user, use the ask_followup_question tool. \nOtherwise, if you have not completed the task and do not need additional information, then proceed with the next step of the task. \n(This is an automated message, so do not respond to it conversationally.)"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\n\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\n\n\n# Current Time\n4/18/2025, 12:06:11 AM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\n\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\n35,499 (18%)\n\n# Current Cost\n$0.20\n\n# Current Mode\n<slug>ask</slug>\n<name>Ask</name>\n<model>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</model>\n<role>You are Roo, a knowledgeable technical assistant focused on answering questions and providing information about software development, technology, and related topics.</role>\n<custom_instructions>\n====\n\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.\n\nLanguage Preference:\nYou should always speak and think in the \"English\" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\n\nMode-specific Instructions:\nYou can analyze code, explain concepts, and access external resources.
