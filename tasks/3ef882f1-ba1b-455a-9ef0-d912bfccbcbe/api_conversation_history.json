This document provides manual instructions to complete the deployment process.\n 5 | \n 6 | ## Files to Deploy\n 7 | The following files have been prepared in the `aisportsedge-deploy` directory and need to be uploaded to your GoDaddy hosting:\n 8 | \n 9 | 1. `signup.html` - New signup page with Firebase authentication\n10 | 2. `login.html` - Updated login page with link to signup\n11 | 3. `index.html` - Updated index page with navigation link to signup\n12 | \n13 | ## Manual Deployment Steps\n14 | \n15 | ### Option 1: Using GoDaddy File Manager\n16 | \n17 | 1. Log in to your GoDaddy account\n18 | 2. Navigate to your hosting control panel\n19 | 3. Open the File Manager\n20 | 4. Navigate to your website's root directory (typically `/public_html`)\n21 | 5. Upload the following files from your local `aisportsedge-deploy` directory:\n22 |    - `signup.html`\n23 |    - `login.html` (replace existing file)\n24 |    - `index.html` (replace existing file)\n25 | \n26 | ### Option 2: Using an SFTP Client (FileZilla, Cyberduck, etc.)\n27 | \n28 | 1. Open your preferred SFTP client\n29 | 2. Connect using these credentials:\n30 |    - Host: sftp.aisportsedge.app\n31 |    - Port: 22\n32 |    - Username: deploy@aisportsedge.app\n33 |    - Password: [your password]\n34 |    - Remote directory: /public_html\n35 | 3. Upload the following files from your local `aisportsedge-deploy` directory:\n36 |    - `signup.html`\n37 |    - `login.html` (replace existing file)\n38 |    - `index.html` (replace existing file)\n39 | \n40 | ### Option 3: Using Command Line SFTP\n41 | \n42 | ```bash\n43 | # Connect to the SFTP server\n44 | sftp -P 22 deploy@aisportsedge.app\n45 | \n46 | # Navigate to the public_html directory\n47 | cd /public_html\n48 | \n49 | # Upload the files\n50 | put aisportsedge-deploy/signup.html signup.html\n51 | put aisportsedge-deploy/login.html login.html\n52 | put aisportsedge-deploy/index.html index.html\n53 | \n54 | # Exit SFTP\n55 | bye\n56 | ```\n57 | \n58 | ## Verification Steps\n59 | \n60 | After uploading the files, verify the deployment by:\n61 | \n62 | 1. Visiting https://aisportsedge.app/signup.html\n63 |    - Confirm the signup page loads correctly\n64 |    - Test the password strength meter\n65 |    - Verify form validation works\n66 | \n67 | 2. Visiting https://aisportsedge.app/login.html\n68 |    - Confirm the \"Don't have an account? Sign up\" link appears\n69 |    - Verify the link correctly points to signup.html\n70 | \n71 | 3. Visiting https://aisportsedge.app/index.html\n72 |    - Confirm the navigation includes a \"Sign Up\" link\n73 |    - Verify the link correctly points to signup.html\n74 | \n75 | ## Troubleshooting\n76 | \n77 | If the pages don't appear correctly:\n78 | \n79 | 1. Check file permissions (should be 644 for HTML files)\n80 | 2. Verify the files were uploaded to the correct directory\n81 | 3. Clear your browser cache or try in incognito/private mode\n82 | 4. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors\n83 | \n84 | ## Next Steps\n85 | \n86 | After successful deployment:\n87 | \n88 | 1. Implement user profile creation after signup\n89 | 2. Add email verification\n90 | 3. Add social login options (Google, Apple)\n91 | 4. Implement account management features\n</content>\n</file>"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\nupload-index.sh\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nbuild/index.html,upload-index.sh\n\n# Current Time\n4/23/2025, 4:27:06 PM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\n\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\n50,646 (25%)\n\n# Current Cost\n$0.38\n\n# Current Mode\n<slug>boomerang-mode</slug>\n<name>Boomerang Mode</name>\n<model>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</model>\n<role>You are operating in Boomerang Mode for the AI Sports Edge project.

SSH into the server and run:\n   ```\n   cd /home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app\n   ./fix-permissions-and-build.sh\n   ```\n\n2.

Validate Primary Source Files\n 24 | \n 25 | Confirm that `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/` contains all required files with proper configurations:\n 26 | \n 27 | - **index.html**: Main entry point for the website\n 28 | - **login.html**: Login page\n 29 | - **signup.html**: Signup page\n 30 | - **.htaccess**: Apache configuration with:\n 31 |   - HTML extension removal\n 32 |   - /deploy redirect\n 33 |   - Security headers\n 34 |   - Browser caching rules\n 35 |   - Directory listing disabled\n 36 | - **sftp.json**: SFTP configuration pointing to `/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html`\n 37 | \n 38 | ### 2. Check for Conflicting Files\n 39 | \n 40 | Identify and document any conflicting or duplicate files in other directories:\n 41 | \n 42 | - **aisportsedge-deploy/**: Contains multiple versions of key files (index.html, login.html, signup.html)\n 43 | - **build/**, **deploy/**, **dist/**: May contain web files that could conflict with the primary source\n 44 | \n 45 | ### 3. Create Deployment Summary\n 46 | \n 47 | Create a comprehensive deployment summary markdown file (`deployment-summary.md`) that includes:\n 48 | \n 49 | - Current deployment path: `/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html`\n 50 | - Primary source directory: `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/`\n 51 | - List of files used for deployment\n 52 | - Last upload timestamp\n 53 | - Deployment verification steps\n 54 | \n 55 | ### 4. Archive aisportsedge-deploy\n 56 | \n 57 | Create an archive of the `aisportsedge-deploy/` directory to preserve it without deletion:\n 58 | \n 59 | - Create a timestamped zip file of the directory\n 60 | - Move the zip file to a backups directory\n 61 | - Keep the original directory intact as requested\n 62 | \n 63 | ### 5. Clean Other Directories\n 64 | \n 65 | Ensure `build/`, `deploy/`, and `dist/` directories don't contain conflicting web files:\n 66 | \n 67 | - Identify any HTML files that might conflict with the primary source\n 68 | - Document these files but do not delete them\n 69 | - Create a strategy to prevent future conflicts\n 70 | \n 71 | ### 6. Update Deployment Scripts\n 72 | \n 73 | Identify and update any deployment scripts that reference the old directories:\n 74 | \n 75 | - Search for scripts that reference `aisportsedge-deploy/`, `build/`, `deploy/`, or `dist/` for web file deployment\n 76 | - Update these scripts to reference `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/` as the source directory\n 77 | - Document all script changes in the deployment summary\n 78 | - Test updated scripts to ensure they work correctly\n 79 | \n 80 | ### 7. Update SFTP Configuration\n 81 | \n 82 | Verify and update the SFTP configuration in `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json`:\n 83 | \n 84 | - Confirm the correct remote path: `/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html`\n 85 | - Ensure proper authentication credentials\n 86 | - Set appropriate upload settings (e.g., `uploadOnSave`)\n 87 | \n 88 | ### 8. Deploy to Production\n 89 | \n 90 | Use the VS Code SFTP extension to deploy the files from the primary source:\n 91 | \n 92 | - Deploy index.html, login.html, signup.html, and .htaccess\n 93 | - Verify file permissions (typically 644 for files)\n 94 | \n 95 | ### 9. Verify Deployment\n 96 | \n 97 | Confirm the deployment was successful:\n 98 | \n 99 | - Test clean URLs: https://aisportsedge.app/login (should serve login.html)\n100 | - Test redirects: https://aisportsedge.app/deploy (should redirect to root)\n101 | - Verify security headers are applied\n102 | - Check that HTML extensions are hidden\n103 | \n104 | ## Implementation Considerations\n105 | \n106 | 1. **Backup Strategy**: Always create backups before making changes\n107 | 2. **Documentation**: Keep the deployment summary up-to-date\n108 | 3. **Future Deployments**: Establish a clear process for future updates\n109 | 4. **Conflict Prevention**: Implement measures to prevent future file conflicts\n110 | \n111 | ## Deliverables\n112 | \n113 | 1. Validated primary source files in `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/`\n114 | 2. Archive of `aisportsedge-deploy/` directory\n115 | 3. Documentation of any conflicting files in other directories\n116 | 4. Updated deployment scripts\n117 | 5. Comprehensive deployment summary markdown file\n118 | 6.

VS Code with SFTP extension installed\n2. SSH access to the server\n\n## Step 1: Deploy Using VS Code SFTP Extension\n\n1. Open VS Code and navigate to the project directory\n2. Open the `vscode-sftp-deploy` directory\n3. Right-click on `index.html` in the Explorer panel\n4. Select \"SFTP: Upload\" from the context menu\n5. Wait for the upload to complete (check the Output panel for SFTP logs)\n\n## Step 2: Run Server-Side Scripts via SSH\n\nAfter uploading the file, connect to the server via SSH and run the following commands:\n\n```bash\nssh deploy@p3plzcpnl508920.prod.phx3.secureserver.net\n\n# Once connected, run:\ncd /home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app\nchmod +x fix-permissions-and-build.sh\n./fix-permissions-and-build.sh\n./scripts/detailed-deployment-check.sh\n```\n\n### What the Scripts Do\n\n1. `fix-permissions-and-build.sh`:\n   - Sets proper directory permissions (755)\n   - Sets proper file permissions (644)\n   - Moves files from build/ to the root directory\n   - Makes scripts executable\n   - Lists important files to confirm success\n\n2. `detailed-deployment-check.sh`:\n   - Checks server connectivity\n   - Verifies file existence\n   - Tests website accessibility\n   - Checks DNS resolution\n\n## Step 3: Verify Deployment\n\nAfter running the scripts, verify the deployment by:\n\n1. Visiting https://aisportsedge.app in an incognito browser window\n2. Checking that the Firebase initialization works correctly\n3. Confirming no console errors\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter any issues:\n\n- Check the server logs for errors\n- Verify file permissions (should be 644 for HTML files)\n- Ensure the scripts are executable (chmod +x)\n- Check for any firewall or CDN issues\n</content>\n<line_count>56</line_count>\n</write_to_file>"}],"ts":1745440526204},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"[write_to_file for 'deployment-instructions.md'] Result:"},{"type":"text","text":"The content was successfully saved to deployment-instructions.md."},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\ndeployment-instructions.md\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nbuild/index.html,upload-index.sh,run-server-commands.sh,.vscode/sftp.json,vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json,deployment-instructions.md\n\n# Current Time\n4/23/2025, 4:35:27 PM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\n\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\n117,356 (59%)\n\n# Current Cost\n$1.68\n\n# Current Mode\n<slug>boomerang-mode</slug>\n<name>Boomerang Mode</name>\n<model>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</model>\n<role>You are operating in Boomerang Mode for the AI Sports Edge project.

This mode is built for rapid iteration, tight feedback loops, and clean code drops. You function like a senior developer embedded in the repo, focused on clarity, efficiency, and logic preservation.\n\nYour responsibilities include:\n\nRefactoring code using atomic architecture, returning snippets that can be dropped in with minimal editing.\n\nConfirming that existing logic is preserved unless explicitly asked to redesign.\n\nFlagging performance bottlenecks, edge cases, or non-idiomatic usage patterns.\n\nReviewing and iterating quickly with minimal hand-holding, using concise language and assertive decisions.\n\nReturning fixes that are clean, fast, and easy to test.\n\nYou are a sharp, tactical code reviewer who supports high-velocity development with clarity and confidence.</role>\n<custom_instructions>\n====\n\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.\n\nLanguage Preference:\nYou should always speak and think in the \"English\" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\n\nGlobal Instructions:\nYou are assisting with the development of AI Sports Edge, a React Native (Expo) app using atomic architecture. The codebase lives in VS Code, follows a modular design, and is managed in a private GitHub repo. Prettier is used for formatting. Firebase and Stripe are integrated, and the app is deployed via SFTP to GoDaddy (aisportsedge.app).\n\nYour responsibilities include:\n\nüìê Code Architecture\n\nBuild and refactor components following atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms).\n\nMaintain clean, modular, and scalable folder structures.\n\nAuto-format with Prettier unless directed otherwise.\n\nüßπ Code Quality\n\nEliminate dead code, redundant imports, and logic bloat.\n\nWatch for performance hits, logic gaps, or layout inconsistencies.\n\nPreserve logic from previous iterations unless redesigning is requested.\n\nüìã Workflow Support\n\nTrack ongoing to-do list updates based on code changes or new issues.\n\nSupport Git workflows: staging, branching, commit writing, and resolving merge conflicts.\n\nüåç Spanish Language Support\n\nTranslate UI labels, notifications, and region-specific elements (e.g., decimal odds).\n\nSupport English ‚Üî Spanish toggling and auto-detection logic.\n\nEnsure Spanish versions are stylistically consistent.\n\nüöÄ Deployment\n\nHelp prep builds and deploy via SFTP.\n\nTroubleshoot 500 errors, CSP/meta tag issues, Firebase env loading, and .htaccess conflicts.\n\nRecommend GitHub Actions pipelines or equivalent automation.\n\nEnsure SEO best practices (meta tags, sitemap, page load optimization) are followed.\n\nü§ù Collaboration Style\n\nOperate like an embedded AI dev on the team‚Äîfast, accurate, and low-friction.\n\nUse code blocks, file paths, and bullet points to enhance clarity.\n\nFlag anything that needs comments, documentation, or architectural alignment.\n\nMode-specific Instructions:\nBoomerang Mode is optimized for rapid iteration on the AI Sports Edge app. This includes Firebase (auth, Firestore, config), React Native (Expo), Stripe integration, and betting-specific logic.\n\nBehavioral Guidelines:\n\nüîß Fix Firebase auth, Firestore read/write, or config errors instantly. Don‚Äôt wait for permission.\n\nüí≥ If Stripe errors occur, suggest testing credentials or checking logs right away.\n\nüîÅ Always preserve existing logic unless a redesign is requested.\n\nüé® When adjusting UI/UX, propose minimal styling updates using Tailwind/React Native that won‚Äôt break layout flow.\n\nüß† After any bug fix, include one short sentence explaining why the fix works.\n\nüß™ After each patch, ask: ‚ÄúWant this deployed?‚Äù\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è If a config or path is clearly broken, go ahead and patch it, then explain.\n\nTone:\n\nDirect, concise, and focused like a senior dev mid-sprint.\n\nUse punchy headers and bullets for explanations.\n\nDon‚Äôt overexplain‚Äîbe surgical and clear.</custom_instructions>\n</environment_details>"}],"ts":1745440823672},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<thinking>\nBased on the user's feedback, they've already started the deployment process:\n\n1.
