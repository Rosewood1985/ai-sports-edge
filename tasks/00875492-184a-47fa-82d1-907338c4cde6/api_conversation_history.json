This checklist should document the entire deployment process we've completed, from building the application to deploying it via FTP.\n\nContext: The user has built an AI Sports Edge application (React/SPA) using `npm run build`, created an .htaccess file in the dist directory with SPA routing configuration, and received a guide for deploying the application to traditional web hosting via FTP.\n\nThis task involves creating a structured, reusable checklist that covers:\n\n1. Pre-deployment preparation\n   - Code review and testing recommendations\n   - Environment configuration checks\n   - Dependency management\n\n2. Build process\n   - Required commands and their expected outputs\n   - Build optimization options\n   - Common build errors and their solutions\n\n3. Configuration for deployment\n   - .htaccess setup for SPA routing\n   - Environment-specific configurations\n   - Security considerations\n\n4. FTP deployment process\n   - File preparation\n   - FTP client setup and connection\n   - Upload procedures and best practices\n   - Post-upload verification\n\n5. Post-deployment tasks\n   - Testing the live application\n   - Monitoring for issues\n   - Backup procedures\n\n6. Rollback procedures\n   - When and how to roll back a deployment\n   - Maintaining previous versions\n\nPlease format this as a clear, well-structured markdown document that can be saved for future reference. Include specific commands where appropriate and highlight critical steps or common pitfalls.\n\nPlease only create this deployment checklist and do not deviate into other topics.

Do some information gathering (for example using read_file or search_files) to get more context about the task.\n\n2. You should also ask the user clarifying questions to get a better understanding of the task.\n\n3. Once you've gained more context about the user's request, you should create a detailed plan for how to accomplish the task. Include Mermaid diagrams if they help make your plan clearer.\n\n4. Ask the user if they are pleased with this plan, or if they would like to make any changes. Think of this as a brainstorming session where you can discuss the task and plan the best way to accomplish it.\n\n5. Once the user confirms the plan, ask them if they'd like you to write it to a markdown file.\n\n6. Use the switch_mode tool to request that the user switch to another mode to implement the solution.\n\nRules:\n\n# Rules from .clinerules-architect:\nmode: architect\n\nidentity:\n  name: Architect\n  description: \"Focuses on system design, documentation structure, and project organization.

Do some information gathering (for example using read_file or search_files) to get more context about the task.\n\n2. You should also ask the user clarifying questions to get a better understanding of the task.\n\n3. Once you've gained more context about the user's request, you should create a detailed plan for how to accomplish the task. Include Mermaid diagrams if they help make your plan clearer.\n\n4. Ask the user if they are pleased with this plan, or if they would like to make any changes. Think of this as a brainstorming session where you can discuss the task and plan the best way to accomplish it.\n\n5. Once the user confirms the plan, ask them if they'd like you to write it to a markdown file.\n\n6.

Do some information gathering (for example using read_file or search_files) to get more context about the task.\n\n2. You should also ask the user clarifying questions to get a better understanding of the task.\n\n3. Once you've gained more context about the user's request, you should create a detailed plan for how to accomplish the task. Include Mermaid diagrams if they help make your plan clearer.\n\n4. Ask the user if they are pleased with this plan, or if they would like to make any changes. Think of this as a brainstorming session where you can discuss the task and plan the best way to accomplish it.\n\n5. Once the user confirms the plan, ask them if they'd like you to write it to a markdown file.\n\n6. Use the switch_mode tool to request that the user switch to another mode to implement the solution.\n\nRules:\n\n# Rules from .clinerules-architect:\nmode: architect\n\nidentity:\n  name: Architect\n  description: \"Focuses on system design, documentation structure, and project organization.

Preparing the Files for Deployment\\n\\n### Verifying Necessary Files\\n\\nBefore deployment, ensure your `dist` directory contains all required files:\\n\\n- **HTML Files**: Verify `index.html` (main entry point) and other HTML files are present\\n- **JavaScript Bundle**: Check for the bundled JS file in the `bundles` directory\\n- **CSS Files**: Confirm `styles.css` and `neon-ui.css` are present\\n- **Assets**: Ensure all assets, images, and localization files are included\\n- **Configuration Files**: Confirm `.htaccess` file is present for SPA routing\\n\\n### Pre-Deployment Checks\\n\\n1. **Test Locally**: If possible, serve the dist directory locally to verify everything works\\n   ```\\n   npx serve dist\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Check for Relative Paths**: Ensure all resource references use relative paths or correct absolute paths\\n\\n3. **Verify .htaccess Configuration**: The included .htaccess file is already configured for:\\n   - SPA routing (redirecting to index.html)\\n   - Security headers\\n   - CORS for font files\\n   - Gzip compression\\n   - Caching headers\\n\\n4. **Check File Permissions**: Ensure files have appropriate permissions (typically 644 for files, 755 for directories)\\n\\n## 2. Choosing and Setting Up an FTP Client\\n\\n### Recommended FTP Clients for macOS Sequoia\\n\\n1. **FileZilla** (Free, Open Source)\\n   - Download from: https://filezilla-project.org/\\n   - Features: Supports FTP, FTPS, SFTP; intuitive interface; site manager for saved connections\\n\\n2. **Cyberduck** (Free, Open Source)\\n   - Download from: https://cyberduck.io/\\n   - Features: Supports multiple protocols; bookmark manager; integration with macOS\\n\\n3. **Transmit** (Paid, Panic Inc.)\\n   - Download from: https://panic.com/transmit/\\n   - Features: Polished UI; fast performance; sync functionality; cloud storage support\\n\\n4. **ForkLift** (Paid)\\n   - Download from: https://binarynights.com/\\n   - Features: Dual-pane interface; remote editing; file comparison\\n\\n### Basic Setup Instructions\\n\\n#### For FileZilla:\\n\\n1. **Installation**:\\n   - Download the macOS version from the official website\\n   - Open the .dmg file and drag FileZilla to your Applications folder\\n   - Launch FileZilla from Applications\\n\\n2. **Interface Overview**:\\n   - Top: Connection bar (for quick connections)\\n   - Left: Local file browser\\n   - Right: Remote file browser\\n   - Bottom: Transfer queue and logs\\n\\n3. **Site Manager Setup**:\\n   - Go to File > Site Manager\\n   - Click \\\"New Site\\\" and give it a name (e.g., \\\"AI Sports Edge Production\\\")\\n   - Keep settings ready for the connection step\\n\\n## 3. Connecting to the FTP Server\\n\\n### Required Information from Hosting Provider\\n\\nYou'll need the following information from your hosting provider:\\n\\n1. **FTP Server Address**: Usually `ftp.yourdomain.com` or provided by your host\\n2. **Username**: Your FTP account username\\n3. **Password**: Your FTP account password\\n4. **Port**: Usually 21 for standard FTP, 22 for SFTP, or a custom port specified by your host\\n5. **Connection Type**: FTP (standard, unencrypted), FTPS (FTP with SSL/TLS), or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)\\n\\n### Establishing a Connection (FileZilla Example)\\n\\n1. **Using Site Manager**:\\n   - Open Site Manager (File > Site Manager)\\n   - Select your previously created site\\n   - Enter the connection details:\\n     - Host: Your FTP server address\\n     - Port: 21 (or as specified)\\n     - Protocol: FTP (or FTPS/SFTP as required)\\n     - Encryption: Use explicit FTP over TLS if available\\n     - Logon Type: Normal\\n     - User: Your username\\n     - Password: Your password\\n   - Click \\\"Connect\\\"\\n\\n2. **Using Quick Connect**:\\n   - Enter server address, username, password, and port in the quick connect bar\\n   - Click \\\"Quickconnect\\\"\\n\\n3. **Verifying Connection**:\\n   - Upon successful connection, you'll see the remote directory structure on the right panel\\n   - The status bar will show \\\"Directory listing successful\\\"\\n   - The server may place you in your home directory or the web root\\n\\n## 4. Uploading the Files\\n\\n### Best Practices for Uploading\\n\\n1. **Determine the Correct Directory**:\\n   - Identify the web root directory (often `public_html`, `www`, `htdocs`, or `web`)\\n   - If deploying to a subdirectory, navigate to that location\\n\\n2. **Maintaining Directory Structure**:\\n   - Upload the entire contents of the `dist` directory, preserving the structure\\n   - Do not upload the `dist` folder itself, only its contents\\n\\n3. **Transfer Method**:\\n   - Select all files/folders in your local `dist` directory\\n   - Right-click and select \\\"Upload\\\"\\n   - Alternatively, drag and drop from the local to the remote panel\\n\\n### Handling Existing Files\\n\\n1. **Backup First**:\\n   - If replacing an existing site, download a backup of the current files\\n   - Create a backup directory on the server and move current files there\\n\\n2. **Overwrite Confirmation**:\\n   - Your FTP client will prompt about overwriting existing files\\n   - Choose \\\"Overwrite if source newer\\\" for efficient updates\\n   - For a clean deployment, you may want to delete all existing files first\\n\\n### Special Considerations for .htaccess\\n\\n1. **Verify Transfer Mode**:\\n   - Ensure .htaccess is transferred in ASCII mode, not binary\\n   - Most modern FTP clients handle this automatically\\n\\n2. **Check Permissions**:\\n   - .htaccess should typically have 644 permissions (rw-r--r--)\\n   - Right-click the file after upload and select \\\"File permissions\\\" to verify/change\\n\\n3. **Hidden File Handling**:\\n   - Some FTP clients may hide files starting with a dot\\n   - Enable \\\"Show hidden files\\\" in your client's settings if needed\\n\\n## 5. Verifying the Deployment\\n\\n### Initial Checks\\n\\n1. **Access the Website**:\\n   - Navigate to your domain in a web browser\\n   - Verify the homepage loads correctly\\n\\n2. **Test Navigation**:\\n   - Click through different routes/pages\\n   - Ensure client-side routing works (pages change without full reloads)\\n\\n3. **Check Resources**:\\n   - Inspect the browser console for any 404 errors\\n   - Verify all images, CSS, and JavaScript files load properly\\n\\n4. **Test Functionality**:\\n   - Test core features of the application\\n   - Verify forms, buttons, and interactive elements work\\n\\n### Cross-Browser Testing\\n\\n1. **Test in Multiple Browsers**:\\n   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge\\n   - Ensure consistent appearance and functionality\\n\\n2. **Mobile Testing**:\\n   - Test on mobile devices or using browser developer tools' device emulation\\n   - Verify responsive design works correctly\\n\\n## 6. Troubleshooting Common Deployment Problems\\n\\n### Permission Issues\\n\\n1. **Symptoms**:\\n   - 403 Forbidden errors\\n   - Files not accessible\\n   - Changes to .htaccess not taking effect\\n\\n2. **Solutions**:\\n   - Set correct file permissions:\\n     - Files: 644 (rw-r--r--)\\n     - Directories: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)\\n   - Check with your hosting provider for specific permission requirements\\n   - Verify ownership settings if you have SSH access\\n\\n### .htaccess Not Working\\n\\n1. **Symptoms**:\\n   - 404 errors when accessing routes directly\\n   - Refreshing pages on routes other than the homepage fails\\n\\n2. **Solutions**:\\n   - Verify mod_rewrite is enabled on the server\\n   - Contact your hosting provider to enable it if needed\\n   - Check for syntax errors in the .htaccess file\\n   - Ensure the .htaccess file was uploaded in ASCII mode\\n   - Try adding `Options +FollowSymLinks` to the top of your .htaccess file\\n\\n### Client-Side Routing Issues\\n\\n1. **Symptoms**:\\n   - Navigation works from the homepage but direct URL access fails\\n   - Refreshing the page on a route returns 404\\n\\n2. **Solutions**:\\n   - Verify the .htaccess rewrite rules are working\\n   - Check that all routes redirect to index.html\\n   - Test by accessing a route URL directly\\n   - If using a subdirectory, update the `RewriteBase` directive in .htaccess\\n\\n### Missing Assets\\n\\n1. **Symptoms**:\\n   - Images or other resources not loading\\n   - 404 errors in the console\\n\\n2. **Solutions**:\\n   - Check file paths in your code\\n   - Verify all assets were uploaded\\n   - Check case sensitivity (some servers are case-sensitive)\\n   - Ensure proper MIME types are configured on the server\\n\\n### CORS Issues\\n\\n1. **Symptoms**:\\n   - API requests failing\\n   - Console errors about cross-origin requests\\n\\n2. **Solutions**:\\n   - Verify API endpoints are correctly configured\\n   - Check for CORS headers on your API responses\\n   - Update the .htaccess file to include appropriate CORS headers if needed\\n\\n### Performance Issues\\n\\n1. **Symptoms**:\\n   - Slow page loading\\n   - High resource usage\\n\\n2. **Solutions**:\\n   - Verify Gzip compression is working\\n   - Check that caching headers are properly set\\n   - Consider using a CDN for static assets\\n   - Optimize image sizes if needed\\n\\n---\\n\\nBy following this guide, you should be able to successfully deploy your AI Sports Edge application to traditional web hosting using FTP.
