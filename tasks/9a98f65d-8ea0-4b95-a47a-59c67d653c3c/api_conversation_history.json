Configure it appropriately for the project structure (e.g., ignoring certain files/directories if necessary).\n    *   **Invalid/Missing Routes:** Analyze the primary routing configuration (likely in `navigation/` or `App.tsx`) to list defined routes. *Note: Statically verifying that components exist for all routes, especially dynamic ones, can be complex. Aim for a best-effort analysis or note limitations.*\n    *   **Runtime Checks (Broken Pages, 404s, Broken Assets):** Implement a basic check using Node.js. This part is more complex and might require a phased approach:\n        *   **Phase 1 (Initial):** Use `node-fetch` (add as dev dependency: `npm install --save-dev node-fetch@^2`) to check the status code of the main `index.html` and potentially a few key known routes (e.g., `/`, `/login`, `/about` - *adjust based on actual app routes*). This requires a local server running the build. The script should *instruct* the user to run `npx serve dist` (or similar) in a separate terminal before running the check script. Check for 200 OK status.\n        *   *(Optional/Future Enhancement):* Parsing `index.html` to find script/link tags and checking their status could be added, but keep the initial version simpler. Checking for specific \"broken page\" indicators is difficult without a full browser environment.\n3.  **Output:** The script should print clear results for each check category (e.g., \"Unused Components Check: Passed\" or \"Unused Components Check: Found 3 unused components: [list]\").\n4.  **Add `package.json` script:** Add a new script command like `\"check:build\": \"node scripts/check-build.js\"` to `package.json`.\n\nConstraint:\n*   Focus *only* on creating the script and adding the necessary dependencies/package script.\n*   Prioritize the static checks (unused components, route listing). Keep the runtime checks simple initially (checking status codes of key pages).\n*   Clearly document within the script (comments) how to run it (including the need for a local server for runtime checks).\n\nCompletion Signal:\n*   When finished, use the `attempt_completion` tool.
