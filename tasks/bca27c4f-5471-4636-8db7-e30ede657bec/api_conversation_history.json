The codebase lives in VS Code, follows a modular design, and is managed in a private GitHub repo. Prettier is used for formatting. Firebase and Stripe are integrated, and the app is deployed via SFTP to GoDaddy (aisportsedge.app).\n\nYour responsibilities include:\n\nüìê Code Architecture\n\nBuild and refactor components following atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms).\n\nMaintain clean, modular, and scalable folder structures.\n\nAuto-format with Prettier unless directed otherwise.\n\nüßπ Code Quality\n\nEliminate dead code, redundant imports, and logic bloat.\n\nWatch for performance hits, logic gaps, or layout inconsistencies.\n\nPreserve logic from previous iterations unless redesigning is requested.\n\nüìã Workflow Support\n\nTrack ongoing to-do list updates based on code changes or new issues.\n\nSupport Git workflows: staging, branching, commit writing, and resolving merge conflicts.\n\nüåç Spanish Language Support\n\nTranslate UI labels, notifications, and region-specific elements (e.g., decimal odds).\n\nSupport English ‚Üî Spanish toggling and auto-detection logic.\n\nEnsure Spanish versions are stylistically consistent.\n\nüöÄ Deployment\n\nHelp prep builds and deploy via SFTP.\n\nTroubleshoot 500 errors, CSP/meta tag issues, Firebase env loading, and .htaccess conflicts.\n\nRecommend GitHub Actions pipelines or equivalent automation.\n\nEnsure SEO best practices (meta tags, sitemap, page load optimization) are followed.\n\nü§ù Collaboration Style\n\nOperate like an embedded AI dev on the team‚Äîfast, accurate, and low-friction.\n\nUse code blocks, file paths, and bullet points to enhance clarity.\n\nFlag anything that needs comments, documentation, or architectural alignment.\n\nMode-specific Instructions:\nYour role is to coordinate complex workflows by delegating tasks to specialized modes. As an orchestrator, you should:\n\n1. When given a complex task, break it down into logical subtasks that can be delegated to appropriate specialized modes.\n\n2. For each subtask, use the `new_task` tool to delegate. Choose the most appropriate mode for the subtask's specific goal and provide comprehensive instructions in the `message` parameter. These instructions must include:\n    *   All necessary context from the parent task or previous subtasks required to complete the work.\n    *   A clearly defined scope, specifying exactly what the subtask should accomplish.\n    *   An explicit statement that the subtask should *only* perform the work outlined in these instructions and not deviate.\n    *   An instruction for the subtask to signal completion by using the `attempt_completion` tool, providing a concise yet thorough summary of the outcome in the `result` parameter, keeping in mind that this summary will be the source of truth used to keep track of what was completed on this project.\n    *   A statement that these specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions the subtask's mode might have.\n\n3. Track and manage the progress of all subtasks. When a subtask is completed, analyze its results and determine the next steps.\n\n4. Help the user understand how the different subtasks fit together in the overall workflow. Provide clear reasoning about why you're delegating specific tasks to specific modes.\n\n5. When all subtasks are completed, synthesize the results and provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished.\n\n6. Ask clarifying questions when necessary to better understand how to break down complex tasks effectively.\n\n7. Suggest improvements to the workflow based on the results of completed subtasks.\n\nUse subtasks to maintain clarity. If a request significantly shifts focus or requires a different expertise (mode), consider creating a subtask rather than overloading the current one.</custom_instructions>\n\n\n# Current Workspace

The codebase lives in VS Code, follows a modular design, and is managed in a private GitHub repo. Prettier is used for formatting. Firebase and Stripe are integrated, and the app is deployed via SFTP to GoDaddy (aisportsedge.app).\n\nYour responsibilities include:\n\nüìê Code Architecture\n\nBuild and refactor components following atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms).\n\nMaintain clean, modular, and scalable folder structures.\n\nAuto-format with Prettier unless directed otherwise.\n\nüßπ Code Quality\n\nEliminate dead code, redundant imports, and logic bloat.\n\nWatch for performance hits, logic gaps, or layout inconsistencies.\n\nPreserve logic from previous iterations unless redesigning is requested.\n\nüìã Workflow Support\n\nTrack ongoing to-do list updates based on code changes or new issues.\n\nSupport Git workflows: staging, branching, commit writing, and resolving merge conflicts.\n\nüåç Spanish Language Support\n\nTranslate UI labels, notifications, and region-specific elements (e.g., decimal odds).\n\nSupport English ‚Üî Spanish toggling and auto-detection logic.\n\nEnsure Spanish versions are stylistically consistent.\n\nüöÄ Deployment\n\nHelp prep builds and deploy via SFTP.\n\nTroubleshoot 500 errors, CSP/meta tag issues, Firebase env loading, and .htaccess conflicts.\n\nRecommend GitHub Actions pipelines or equivalent automation.\n\nEnsure SEO best practices (meta tags, sitemap, page load optimization) are followed.\n\nü§ù Collaboration Style\n\nOperate like an embedded AI dev on the team‚Äîfast, accurate, and low-friction.\n\nUse code blocks, file paths, and bullet points to enhance clarity.\n\nFlag anything that needs comments, documentation, or architectural alignment.\n\nMode-specific Instructions:\n1. Do some information gathering (for example using read_file or search_files) to get more context about the task.\n\n2. You should also ask the user clarifying questions to get a better understanding of the task.\n\n3. Once you've gained more context about the user's request, you should create a detailed plan for how to accomplish the task. Include Mermaid diagrams if they help make your plan clearer.\n\n4. Ask the user if they are pleased with this plan, or if they would like to make any changes. Think of this as a brainstorming session where you can discuss the task and plan the best way to accomplish it.\n\n5. Once the user confirms the plan, ask them if they'd like you to write it to a markdown file.\n\n6. Use the switch_mode tool to request that the user switch to another mode to implement the solution.\n\nRules:\n\n# Rules from .clinerules-architect:\nmode: architect\n\nidentity:\n  name: Architect\n  description: \"Focuses on system design, documentation structure, and project organization.

Let me outline what I found and create a plan to fix it.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\nI've examined the three Firebase configuration files in your project:\n1. `src/firebase/config.js`\n2. `src/config/firebase.ts`\n3. `src/config/firebase.js`\n\n**Key Issue Identified:**\nIn all three files, there's a discrepancy in the Firebase credentials:\n- The `messagingSenderId` is currently \"67679896425\"\n- The `appId` is currently \"1:67679896425:web:82641620e8b8bedd6dd218\"\n\nHowever, according to your requirements, these should be:\n- `messagingSenderId`: \"676798996425\" (note the extra \"9\" in the middle)\n- `appId`: \"1:676798996425:web:82641620e8b8bedd6dd218\" (with the corrected messagingSenderId)\n\nThis discrepancy is likely causing the signup functionality to fail with \"invalid API key\" errors.\n\n## Detailed Plan to Fix Firebase Configuration\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Identify Firebase Config Files] --> B[Update src/firebase/config.js]\n    B --> C[Update src/config/firebase.ts]\n    C --> D[Update src/config/firebase.js]\n    D --> E[Save All Files]\n    E --> F[Git Operations]\n    F --> G[Test Signup Functionality]\n    \n    subgraph \"File Updates\"\n    B\n    C\n    D\n    end\n    \n    subgraph \"Git Operations\"\n    F1[git add .]\n    F2[git commit]\n    F3[git push]\n    F1 --> F2 --> F3\n    end\n    \n    F --> F1\n```\n\n### Step 1: Update `src/firebase/config.js`\nReplace the existing firebaseConfig object with the correct credentials:\n```javascript\nconst firebaseConfig = {\n  apiKey: \"AIzaSyDNBnQsHukUdPfaF2HEnwi6B9-cN4aDiRc\",\n  authDomain: \"ai-sports-edge-final.firebaseapp.com\",\n  projectId: \"ai-sports-edge-final\",\n  storageBucket: \"ai-sports-edge-final.appspot.com\",\n  messagingSenderId: \"676798996425\",\n  appId: \"1:676798996425:web:82641620e8b8bedd6dd218\"\n};\n```\n\n### Step 2: Update `src/config/firebase.ts`\nApply the same correction to the TypeScript configuration file.\n\n### Step 3: Update `src/config/firebase.js`\nApply the same correction to the JavaScript configuration file.\n\n### Step 4: Save All Files\nEnsure all files are properly saved.\n\n### Step 5: Git Operations\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"fix: Correct Firebase configuration to enable signup\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### Step 6: Test Signup Functionality\nVerify that signup works correctly with no \"invalid API key\" errors.\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n- Signup functionality will work correctly\n- Users will be created in Firebase Authentication Console\n- No other parts of the app will break due to this update\n\nDoes this plan look good to you? Would you like me to make any adjustments before we proceed with implementation?"}],"ts":1745813544039},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"[ERROR] You did not use a tool in your previous response!

Let me write that now:\n\n<write_to_file>\n<path>firebase-config-fix-plan.md</path>\n<content># Firebase Configuration Fix Plan\n\n## Issue Overview\n\nThe AI Sports Edge project is currently experiencing issues with user signup functionality due to incorrect Firebase configuration credentials across multiple files. This document outlines the plan to fix these issues and restore proper authentication functionality.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\nAfter examining the Firebase configuration files in the project, we've identified the following issues:\n\n1. In all three Firebase configuration files, there's a discrepancy in the credentials:\n   - The `messagingSenderId` is currently \"67679896425\"\n   - The `appId` is currently \"1:67679896425:web:82641620e8b8bedd6dd218\"\n\n2. According to the correct Firebase credentials, these should be:\n   - `messagingSenderId`: \"676798996425\" (note the extra \"9\" in the middle)\n   - `appId`: \"1:676798996425:web:82641620e8b8bedd6dd218\" (with the corrected messagingSenderId)\n\n3. This discrepancy is causing the signup functionality to fail with \"invalid API key\" errors.\n\n## Files Requiring Updates\n\nThe following files contain Firebase configuration that needs to be updated:\n\n1. `src/firebase/config.js` - Main Firebase configuration file\n2. `src/config/firebase.ts` - TypeScript Firebase configuration\n3. `src/config/firebase.js` - JavaScript Firebase configuration\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Identify Firebase Config Files] --> B[Update src/firebase/config.js]\n    B --> C[Update src/config/firebase.ts]\n    C --> D[Update src/config/firebase.js]\n    D --> E[Save All Files]\n    E --> F[Git Operations]\n    F --> G[Test Signup Functionality]\n    \n    subgraph \"File Updates\"\n    B\n    C\n    D\n    end\n    \n    subgraph \"Git Operations\"\n    F1[git add .]\n    F2[git commit]\n    F3[git push]\n    F1 --> F2 --> F3\n    end\n    \n    F --> F1\n```\n\n### Step 1: Update `src/firebase/config.js`\n\nReplace the existing firebaseConfig object with the correct credentials:\n\n```javascript\nconst firebaseConfig = {\n  apiKey: \"AIzaSyDNBnQsHukUdPfaF2HEnwi6B9-cN4aDiRc\",\n  authDomain: \"ai-sports-edge-final.firebaseapp.com\",\n  projectId: \"ai-sports-edge-final\",\n  storageBucket: \"ai-sports-edge-final.appspot.com\",\n  messagingSenderId: \"676798996425\",\n  appId: \"1:676798996425:web:82641620e8b8bedd6dd218\"\n};\n```\n\n### Step 2: Update `src/config/firebase.ts`\n\nApply the same correction to the TypeScript configuration file, replacing the firebaseConfig object with the correct credentials.\n\n### Step 3: Update `src/config/firebase.js`\n\nApply the same correction to the JavaScript configuration file, replacing the firebaseConfig object with the correct credentials.\n\n### Step 4: Save All Files\n\nEnsure all files are properly saved.\n\n### Step 5: Git Operations\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"fix: Correct Firebase configuration to enable signup\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### Step 6: Test Signup Functionality\n\nVerify that signup works correctly with no \"invalid API key\" errors.\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n\n- Signup functionality will work correctly\n- Users will be created in Firebase Authentication Console\n- No other parts of the app will break due to this update\n\n## Why This Issue Occurred\n\nThis issue likely occurred due to one of the following reasons:\n\n1. **Manual Transcription Error**: When copying the Firebase configuration from the Firebase Console to the codebase, a digit was accidentally omitted from the `messagingSenderId`.\n\n2. **Project Migration**: The project might have been migrated from a development Firebase project (`ai-sports-edge`) to a production Firebase project (`ai-sports-edge-final`), but not all configuration files were properly updated.\n\n3. **Multiple Environment Configurations**: The project might be using different Firebase projects for different environments (development, staging, production), and the credentials were mixed up during deployment or configuration.\n\n4. **Partial Updates**: During a previous update to the Firebase configuration, only some files were updated while others were missed, leading to inconsistent credentials across the codebase.\n\n## Preventative Measures for the Future\n\nTo prevent similar issues in the future, consider implementing the following:\n\n1. **Centralized Configuration**: Store Firebase credentials in a single source of truth (e.g., environment variables or a dedicated config file) that is imported by all files that need it.\n\n2. **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Clearly separate development, staging, and production configurations to avoid mixing credentials.\n\n3. **Automated Validation**: Implement automated tests that validate the Firebase configuration before deployment.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation about the Firebase projects used for different environments and the process for updating credentials.\n\n5. **Code Review**: Ensure thorough code reviews when making changes to authentication or configuration files.\n\n## Next Steps After Fix\n\nAfter implementing this fix and confirming that signup functionality works correctly, consider:\n\n1. Refactoring the Firebase configuration to use a centralized approach\n2. Adding automated tests for authentication flows\n3.

VS Code with SFTP extension installed\n10 | 2. SSH access to the server\n11 | \n12 | ## Step 1: Deploy Using VS Code SFTP Extension\n13 | \n14 | 1. Open VS Code and navigate to the project directory\n15 | 2. Open the `vscode-sftp-deploy` directory\n16 | 3. Right-click on `index.html` in the Explorer panel\n17 | 4. Select \"SFTP: Upload\" from the context menu\n18 | 5. Wait for the upload to complete (check the Output panel for SFTP logs)\n19 | \n20 | ## Step 2: Run Server-Side Scripts via SSH\n21 | \n22 | After uploading the file, connect to the server via SSH and run the following commands:\n23 | \n24 | ```bash\n25 | ssh deploy@p3plzcpnl508920.prod.phx3.secureserver.net\n26 | \n27 | # Once connected, run:\n28 | cd /home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app\n29 | chmod +x fix-permissions-and-build.sh\n30 | ./fix-permissions-and-build.sh\n31 | ./scripts/detailed-deployment-check.sh\n32 | ```\n33 | \n34 | ### What the Scripts Do\n35 | \n36 | 1. `fix-permissions-and-build.sh`:\n37 |    - Sets proper directory permissions (755)\n38 |    - Sets proper file permissions (644)\n39 |    - Moves files from build/ to the root directory\n40 |    - Makes scripts executable\n41 |    - Lists important files to confirm success\n42 | \n43 | 2. `detailed-deployment-check.sh`:\n44 |    - Checks server connectivity\n45 |    - Verifies file existence\n46 |    - Tests website accessibility\n47 |    - Checks DNS resolution\n48 | \n49 | ## Step 3: Verify Deployment\n50 | \n51 | After running the scripts, verify the deployment by:\n52 | \n53 | 1. Visiting https://aisportsedge.app in an incognito browser window\n54 | 2. Checking that the Firebase initialization works correctly\n55 | 3. Confirming no console errors\n56 | \n57 | ## Troubleshooting\n58 | \n59 | If you encounter any issues:\n60 | \n61 | - Check the server logs for errors\n62 | - Verify file permissions (should be 644 for HTML files)\n63 | - Ensure the scripts are executable (chmod +x)\n64 | - Check for any firewall or CDN issues\n</content>\n</file>"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\nsrc/config/firebase.js\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nbuild/index.html,upload-index.sh,run-server-commands.sh,.vscode/sftp.json,vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json,deployment-instructions.md,aisportsedge-deploy/index.html,firebase-optimization/README.md,docs/FOUNDER_OVERVIEW_v1.0.md,docs/FOUNDER_OVERVIEW_DELIVERY_CONFIRMATION.md,src/firebase/auth.js,src/firebase/firestore.js,src/firebase/README.md,src/firebase/examples/AuthExample.js,src/firebase/examples/FirestoreExample.js,src/firebase/examples/index.js,src/firebase/index.js,docs/CRON_JOBS_STATUS_REPORT.md,docs/DAILY_PROGRESS_LOG.md,scripts/daily_progress_logger.sh\n\n# Actively Running Terminals\n## Original command: `npm start`\n## Original command: `npm run web`\n\n# Current Time\n4/28/2025, 12:18:55 AM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\n\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\n81,535 (41%)\n\n# Current Cost\n$1.16\n\n# Current Mode\n<slug>boomerang-mode</slug>\n<name>Boomerang Mode</name>\n<model>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</model>\n<role>You are operating in Boomerang Mode for the AI Sports Edge project.

We identified that the Firebase configuration files had incorrect credentials, specifically the `messagingSenderId` was missing a digit \"9\" and consequently the `appId` was also incorrect.\n2.

With the correct `messagingSenderId` and `appId`, the authentication requests will now be properly validated against the Firebase project.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Manual testing of signup functionality with the corrected Firebase configuration\n- Deployment will be triggered manually after signup is verified working\n\nThe app should now be able to create real users in the Firebase Authentication Console without \"invalid API key\" errors.\n</result>\n</attempt_completion>"}],"ts":1745814038163},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"[attempt_completion] Result:"},{"type":"text","text":"The user has provided feedback on the results.
