Confirmed all required directories exist\n  2. Verified Git is properly initialized\n  3. Confirmed the Node.js environment is valid\n  4. Fixed Firebase configuration inconsistencies across platforms\n\n## Your Task\n1. Check the Git status to see the changes made\n2. Stage all changes using `git add .`\n3. Commit the changes with the message: \"chore: Validate project structure, update firebase config, confirm npm and git readiness\"\n4. Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin main`\n\nPlease only perform the work outlined in these instructions and do not deviate.
