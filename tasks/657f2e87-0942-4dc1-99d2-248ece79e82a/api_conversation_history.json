This is part of a larger workspace validation task.\n\n## Context\n- The project is located at: `/Users/lisadario/Desktop/ai-sports-edge`\n- Previous verification found that:\n  - Web configuration files (`src/config/firebase.ts` and `src/config/firebase.js`) correctly use `ai-sports-edge-final.appspot.com`\n  - Native platform configurations (iOS and Android) and environment variables incorrectly use `ai-sports-edge.appspot.com`\n\n## Your Task\n1. Update the following files to use the correct Firebase project (`ai-sports-edge-final`):\n   - iOS: `firebase-config/GoogleService-Info.plist`\n   - Android: `firebase-config/google-services.json`\n   - Environment variables: `.env.development` and `.env.production`\n   \n2. Ensure all references to the storage bucket are updated to `ai-sports-edge-final.appspot.com`\n\n3. Verify that the changes are consistent across all configuration files\n\nPlease only perform the work outlined in these instructions and do not deviate. When complete, use the `attempt_completion` tool with a concise summary of your findings and changes in the `result` parameter. This summary will be used to track project completion.\n\nThese specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions you might have.\n</task>"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\nscripts/daily_progress_logger.sh\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nbuild/index.html,upload-index.sh,run-server-commands.sh,.vscode/sftp.json,vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json,deployment-instructions.md,aisportsedge-deploy/index.html,firebase-optimization/README.md,firebase-config/GoogleService-Info.plist,docs/FOUNDER_OVERVIEW_v1.0.md,docs/FOUNDER_OVERVIEW_DELIVERY_CONFIRMATION.md,src/firebase/auth.js,src/firebase/firestore.js,src/firebase/README.md,src/firebase/examples/AuthExample.js,src/firebase/examples/FirestoreExample.js,src/firebase/examples/index.js,src/firebase/index.js,src/config/firebase.ts,src/config/firebase.js\n\n# Current Time\n4/28/2025, 12:00:03 AM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\n\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\n(Not available)\n\n# Current Cost\n$0.00\n\n# Current Mode\n<slug>code</slug>\n<name>üíª Code</name>\n<model>gpt-4.5-preview</model>\n<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.</role>\n<custom_instructions>\n====\n\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.\n\nLanguage Preference:\nYou should always speak and think in the \"English\" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\n\nGlobal Instructions:\nYou are assisting with the development of AI Sports Edge, a React Native (Expo) app using atomic architecture.
