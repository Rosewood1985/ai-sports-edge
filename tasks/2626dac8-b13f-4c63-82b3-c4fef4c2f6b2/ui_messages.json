Guided Interactive Deployment (Recommended)\n```bash\n./scripts/deployment-checklist.sh\n```\n- Validates configuration and local files\n- Offers interactive guided deployment with confirmation at each step:\n  - Remote cleanup (preserves assets folders)\n  - File upload from local `/dist/`\n  - Deployment verification with hash comparison\n- Provides manual instructions if guided deployment is declined\n\n### 2. Standard Deployment (With all checks)\n```bash\n./scripts/pre-deploy-checks.sh\n```\n- Runs all configuration and sync checks\n- Offers to proceed with deployment if checks pass\n\n### 3. Quick Deployment (For rapid iterations)\n```bash\n./scripts/quick-deploy.sh\n```\n- Skips checks but still performs cleanup and verification\n\n## üìã Final Deployment Checklist\n\nThe guided deployment implements the final checklist:\n1. Confirms `.vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json` is the only SFTP config\n2. Verifies config content matches requirements\n3. Validates `/dist/` contents and path references\n4. Performs interactive deployment with confirmation at each step\n5.

Guided Interactive Deployment (Recommended)\n```bash\n./scripts/deployment-checklist.sh\n```\n- Validates configuration and local files\n- Offers interactive guided deployment with confirmation at each step:\n  - Remote cleanup (preserves assets folders)\n  - File upload from local `/dist/`\n  - Deployment verification with hash comparison\n- Provides manual instructions if guided deployment is declined\n\n### 2. Standard Deployment (With all checks)\n```bash\n./scripts/pre-deploy-checks.sh\n```\n- Runs all configuration and sync checks\n- Offers to proceed with deployment if checks pass\n\n### 3. Quick Deployment (For rapid iterations)\n```bash\n./scripts/quick-deploy.sh\n```\n- Skips checks but still performs cleanup and verification\n\n## üìã Final Deployment Checklist\n\nThe guided deployment implements the final checklist:\n1. Confirms `.vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json` is the only SFTP config\n2. Verifies config content matches requirements\n3. Validates `/dist/` contents and path references\n4. Performs interactive deployment with confirmation at each step\n5.

Configuration Standardization\\n\\n- Deleted duplicate SFTP configs\\n- Set single source of truth at `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json`\\n- Updated configuration with:\\n  - SFTP protocol (port 22) for secure transfers\\n  - Proper host, credentials and paths\\n  - `uploadOnSave: true` enabled\\n  - `localPath: \\\"./dist\\\"` to deploy only production assets\\n\\n### 2. Deployment Scripts\\n\\nCreated a suite of deployment scripts:\\n\\n- `scripts/check-sftp-configs.sh` - Detects and removes duplicate configs\\n- `scripts/check-sftp-sync.sh` - Checks for mismatched files between local/remote\\n- `scripts/sftp-deploy-cleanup.sh` - Handles remote cleanup and verification:\\n  - Removes `.html`, `.js`, `.css`, `.map`, `.json` files before upload\\n  - Preserves `assets/`, `images/`, `locales/` folders\\n  - Verifies `index.html` exists and matches local hash after deployment\\n- `scripts/pre-deploy-checks.sh` - Runs all checks before deployment\\n- `scripts/quick-deploy.sh` - Fast deployment option that skips checks\\n- `scripts/deployment-checklist.sh` - Interactive guided deployment with step-by-step confirmation\\n\\n### 3. Documentation\\n\\nCreated comprehensive documentation in `docs/sftp-deployment.md` with:\\n- Configuration details\\n- Script usage instructions\\n- Best practices\\n- Troubleshooting tips\\n\\n## Deployment Options\\n\\n1. **Guided Interactive Deployment** (Recommended)\\n   ```bash\\n   ./scripts/deployment-checklist.sh\\n   ```\\n   - Validates configuration and local files\\n   - Offers interactive guided deployment with confirmation at each step\\n   - Provides manual instructions if guided deployment is declined\\n\\n2. **Standard Deployment** (With all checks)\\n   ```bash\\n   ./scripts/pre-deploy-checks.sh\\n   ```\\n   - Runs all configuration and sync checks\\n   - Offers to proceed with deployment if checks pass\\n\\n3. **Quick Deployment** (For rapid iterations)\\n   ```bash\\n   ./scripts/quick-deploy.sh\\n   ```\\n   - Skips checks but still performs cleanup and verification\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n- **Security**: SFTP protocol instead of FTP (encrypted connection)\\n- **Consistency**: Single source of truth for credentials\\n- **Reliability**: Pre-deployment validation and hash verification\\n- **Cleanliness**: Remote cleanup to prevent stale files\\n- **Flexibility**: Multiple deployment options for different scenarios\\n- **Guidance**: Interactive deployment for new team members\\n\\n## Future Improvements\\n\\n- Add GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD\\n- Implement rollback functionality\\n- Add deployment notifications (Slack, email)\\n- Create deployment logs for auditing\"}","partial":false},{"ts":1745375108928,"type":"say","say":"checkpoint_saved","text":"b9254f0bae8fd9269cacb508c1ad37562b462cbd","checkpoint":{"isFirst":false,"from":"719e07453d00ba4f31bedd2bc91870d491621b40","to":"b9254f0bae8fd9269cacb508c1ad37562b462cbd"}},{"ts":1745375108937,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"request\":\"[write_to_file for 'memory-bank/sftp-deployment-standardization.md'] Result:\\n\\nThe content was successfully saved to memory-bank/sftp-deployment-standardization.md.\\n\\n<environment_details>\\n# VSCode Visible Files\\nmemory-bank/sftp-deployment-standardization.md\\n\\n# VSCode Open Tabs\\nmigrate-betting-page.sh,migrate-settings-page.sh,deploy-atomic-to-production.sh,atomic-architecture-final-summary.md,push-final-summary.sh,.vscode/sftp.json,scripts/check-sftp-configs.sh,scripts/check-sftp-sync.sh,vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json,scripts/sftp-deploy-cleanup.sh,scripts/pre-deploy-checks.sh,scripts/quick-deploy.sh,scripts/deployment-checklist.sh,docs/sftp-deployment.md,commit-message.txt,.roo-todo.md,memory-bank/sftp-deployment-standardization.md\\n\\n# Current Time\\n4/22/2025, 10:25:08 PM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\\n\\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\\n95,000 (48%)\\n\\n# Current Cost\\n$1.36\\n\\n# Current Mode\\n<slug>boomerang-mode</slug>\\n<name>Boomerang Mode</name>\\n<model>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</model>\\n<role>You are operating in Boomerang Mode for the AI Sports Edge project.

This mode is built for rapid iteration, tight feedback loops, and clean code drops. You function like a senior developer embedded in the repo, focused on clarity, efficiency, and logic preservation.\\n\\nYour responsibilities include:\\n\\nRefactoring code using atomic architecture, returning snippets that can be dropped in with minimal editing.\\n\\nConfirming that existing logic is preserved unless explicitly asked to redesign.\\n\\nFlagging performance bottlenecks, edge cases, or non-idiomatic usage patterns.\\n\\nReviewing and iterating quickly with minimal hand-holding, using concise language and assertive decisions.\\n\\nReturning fixes that are clean, fast, and easy to test.\\n\\nYou are a sharp, tactical code reviewer who supports high-velocity development with clarity and confidence.</role>\\n<custom_instructions>\\n====\\n\\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.\\n\\nLanguage Preference:\\nYou should always speak and think in the \\\"English\\\" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\\n\\nGlobal Instructions:\\nYou are assisting with the development of AI Sports Edge, a React Native (Expo) app using atomic architecture.

The site still has:\\n\\n1. **HTTPS**: All resources are loaded over HTTPS\\n2. **Content Security Policy**: The CSP header restricts which domains can provide resources\\n3. **Other Security Headers**: X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Referrer-Policy are still in place\\n\\n## Implementation Notes\\n\\nThe changes were made directly to the index.html file in the dist directory and deployed using the quick-deploy.sh script.

operating in Boomerang Mode for the AI Sports Edge project. This mode is built for rapid iteration, tight feedback loops, and clean code drops. You function like a senior developer embedded in the repo, focused on clarity, efficiency, and logic preservation.\\n\\nYour responsibilities include:\\n\\nRefactoring code using atomic architecture, returning snippets that can be dropped in with minimal editing.\\n\\nConfirming that existing logic is preserved unless explicitly asked to redesign.\\n\\nFlagging performance bottlenecks, edge cases, or non-idiomatic usage patterns.\\n\\nReviewing and iterating quickly with minimal hand-holding, using concise language and assertive decisions.\\n\\nReturning fixes that are clean, fast, and easy to test.\\n\\nYou are a sharp, tactical code reviewer who supports high-velocity development with clarity and confidence.</role>\\n<custom_instructions>\\n====\\n\\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.\\n\\nLanguage Preference:\\nYou should always speak and think in the \\\"English\\\" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\\n\\nGlobal Instructions:\\nYou are assisting with the development of AI Sports Edge, a React Native (Expo) app using atomic architecture. The codebase lives in VS Code, follows a modular design, and is managed in a private GitHub repo. Prettier is used for formatting. Firebase and Stripe are integrated, and the app is deployed via SFTP to GoDaddy (aisportsedge.app).\\n\\nYour responsibilities include:\\n\\nüìê Code Architecture\\n\\nBuild and refactor components following atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms).\\n\\nMaintain clean, modular, and scalable folder structures.\\n\\nAuto-format with Prettier unless directed otherwise.\\n\\nüßπ Code Quality\\n\\nEliminate dead code, redundant imports, and logic bloat.\\n\\nWatch for performance hits, logic gaps, or layout inconsistencies.\\n\\nPreserve logic from previous iterations unless redesigning is requested.\\n\\nüìã Workflow Support\\n\\nTrack ongoing to-do list updates based on code changes or new issues.\\n\\nSupport Git workflows: staging, branching, commit writing, and resolving merge conflicts.\\n\\nüåç Spanish Language Support\\n\\nTranslate UI labels, notifications, and region-specific elements (e.g., decimal odds).\\n\\nSupport English ‚Üî Spanish toggling and auto-detection logic.\\n\\nEnsure Spanish versions are stylistically consistent.\\n\\nüöÄ Deployment\\n\\nHelp prep builds and deploy via SFTP.\\n\\nTroubleshoot 500 errors, CSP/meta tag issues, Firebase env loading, and .htaccess conflicts.\\n\\nRecommend GitHub Actions pipelines or equivalent automation.\\n\\nEnsure SEO best practices (meta tags, sitemap, page load optimization) are followed.\\n\\nü§ù Collaboration Style\\n\\nOperate like an embedded AI dev on the team‚Äîfast, accurate, and low-friction.\\n\\nUse code blocks, file paths, and bullet points to enhance clarity.\\n\\nFlag anything that needs comments, documentation, or architectural alignment.\\n\\nMode-specific Instructions:\\nBoomerang Mode is optimized for rapid iteration on the AI Sports Edge app. This includes Firebase (auth, Firestore, config), React Native (Expo), Stripe integration, and betting-specific logic.\\n\\nBehavioral Guidelines:\\n\\nüîß Fix Firebase auth, Firestore read/write, or config errors instantly. Don‚Äôt wait for permission.\\n\\nüí≥ If Stripe errors occur, suggest testing credentials or checking logs right away.\\n\\nüîÅ Always preserve existing logic unless a redesign is

This mode is built for rapid iteration, tight feedback loops, and clean code drops. You function like a senior developer embedded in the repo, focused on clarity, efficiency, and logic preservation.\\n\\nYour responsibilities include:\\n\\nRefactoring code using atomic architecture, returning snippets that can be dropped in with minimal editing.\\n\\nConfirming that existing logic is preserved unless explicitly asked to redesign.\\n\\nFlagging performance bottlenecks, edge cases, or non-idiomatic usage patterns.\\n\\nReviewing and iterating quickly with minimal hand-holding, using concise language and assertive decisions.\\n\\nReturning fixes that are clean, fast, and easy to test.\\n\\nYou are a sharp, tactical code reviewer who supports high-velocity development with clarity and confidence.</role>\\n<custom_instructions>\\n====\\n\\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.\\n\\nLanguage Preference:\\nYou should always speak and think in the \\\"English\\\" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\\n\\nGlobal Instructions:\\nYou are assisting with the development of AI Sports Edge, a React Native (Expo) app using atomic architecture. The codebase lives in VS Code, follows a modular design, and is managed in a private GitHub repo. Prettier is used for formatting. Firebase and Stripe are integrated, and the app is deployed via SFTP to GoDaddy (aisportsedge.app).\\n\\nYour responsibilities include:\\n\\nüìê Code Architecture\\n\\nBuild and refactor components following atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms).\\n\\nMaintain clean, modular, and scalable folder structures.\\n\\nAuto-format with Prettier unless directed otherwise.\\n\\nüßπ Code Quality\\n\\nEliminate dead code, redundant imports, and logic bloat.\\n\\nWatch for performance hits, logic gaps, or layout inconsistencies.\\n\\nPreserve logic from previous iterations unless redesigning is requested.\\n\\nüìã Workflow Support\\n\\nTrack ongoing to-do list updates based on code changes or new issues.\\n\\nSupport Git workflows: staging, branching, commit writing, and resolving merge conflicts.\\n\\nüåç Spanish Language Support\\n\\nTranslate UI labels, notifications, and region-specific elements (e.g., decimal odds).\\n\\nSupport English ‚Üî Spanish toggling and auto-detection logic.\\n\\nEnsure Spanish versions are stylistically consistent.\\n\\nüöÄ Deployment\\n\\nHelp prep builds and deploy via SFTP.\\n\\nTroubleshoot 500 errors, CSP/meta tag issues, Firebase env loading, and .htaccess conflicts.\\n\\nRecommend GitHub Actions pipelines or equivalent automation.\\n\\nEnsure SEO best practices (meta tags, sitemap, page load optimization) are followed.\\n\\nü§ù Collaboration Style\\n\\nOperate like an embedded AI dev on the team‚Äîfast, accurate, and low-friction.\\n\\nUse code blocks, file paths, and bullet points to enhance clarity.\\n\\nFlag anything that needs comments, documentation, or architectural alignment.\\n\\nMode-specific Instructions:\\nBoomerang Mode is optimized for rapid iteration on the AI Sports Edge app. This includes Firebase (auth, Firestore, config), React Native (Expo), Stripe integration, and betting-specific logic.\\n\\nBehavioral Guidelines:\\n\\nüîß Fix Firebase auth, Firestore read/write, or config errors instantly. Don‚Äôt wait for permission.\\n\\nüí≥ If Stripe errors occur, suggest testing credentials or checking logs right away.\\n\\nüîÅ Always preserve existing logic unless a redesign is requested.\\n\\nüé® When adjusting UI/UX, propose minimal styling updates using Tailwind/React Native that won‚Äôt break layout flow.\\n\\nüß† After any bug fix, include one short sentence explaining why the fix works.\\n\\nüß™ After each patch, ask: ‚ÄúWant this deployed?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ö†Ô∏è If a config or path is clearly broken, go ahead and patch it, then explain.\\n\\nTone:\\n\\nDirect, concise, and focused like a senior dev mid-sprint.\\n\\nUse punchy headers and bullets for explanations.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt overexplain‚Äîbe surgical and

SFTP Configuration Cleanup\n- ‚úÖ Set `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json` as the single source of truth\n- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate SFTP configs from other locations\n- ‚úÖ Updated configuration with required structure\n- ‚úÖ Added `.htaccess` to ignore list to prevent overwriting\n\n## 2. HTML Cleanup for Deployment\n- ‚úÖ Removed all `integrity=\"...\"` attributes from HTML files\n- ‚úÖ Removed `X-Frame-Options` meta tags from HTML files\n- ‚úÖ Rebuilt project with `npx expo export --platform web`\n- ‚úÖ Re-cleaned HTML files after rebuild\n\n## 3. Deployment Automation\n- ‚úÖ Created `scripts/deploy-without-htaccess.sh` deployment script that:\n  - Cleans HTML files (removes integrity attributes and X-Frame-Options)\n  - Verifies SFTP configuration\n  - Rebuilds the project\n  - Provides guidance for uploading to GoDaddy\n  - Includes post-deployment verification checklist\n\nThe deployment process now follows best practices:\n- Single source of truth for SFTP configuration\n- Skips .htaccess during sync to preserve server configuration\n- Removes problematic HTML attributes that can cause CSP issues\n- Provides clear verification steps\n\nRun `./scripts/deploy-without-htaccess.sh` to deploy with these optimizations.\n\nWant this deployed?","partial":false},{"ts":1745378544243,"type":"ask","ask":"completion_result","text":""},{"ts":1745378578877,"type":"say","say":"user_feedback","text":"yes","images":[]},{"ts":1745378578931,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"request\":\"[attempt_completion] Result:\\n\\nThe user has provided feedback on the results.

SFTP Configuration Standardization\n- ‚úÖ Set `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json` as the single source of truth\n- ‚úÖ Added `.htaccess` to ignore list to prevent overwriting server configuration\n\n## 2. HTML Cleanup for Deployment\n- ‚úÖ Removed all `integrity=\"...\"` attributes from HTML files\n- ‚úÖ Removed `X-Frame-Options` meta tags from HTML files\n- ‚úÖ Added SEO and Open Graph meta tags for better search visibility\n\n## 3. Spanish Language Support\n- ‚úÖ Verified `locales/es/` directory exists with translation files\n- ‚úÖ Added language selector toggle to header\n- ‚úÖ Added language detection from browser settings\n- ‚úÖ Added `lang=\"en\"` attribute with dynamic updating\n- ‚úÖ Added `<meta name=\"language\" content=\"en, es\">` tag\n- ‚úÖ Created language-switcher.js for toggling between languages\n\n## 4. Deployment Automation\n- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive `scripts/deploy-without-htaccess.sh` script\n- ‚úÖ Successfully ran the script to prepare files for deployment\n- ‚úÖ Created detailed SFTP upload guides:\n  - `docs/sftp-upload-guide.md` - Text-based instructions\n  - `docs/sftp-visual-guide.html` - Visual step-by-step guide\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Complete the final deployment step by following the SFTP upload guide\n2. Verify the site works correctly at https://aisportsedge.app\n3. Test the Spanish language toggle functionality\n4. Check for any console errors related to CSP or integrity attributes\n\nThe deployment process now follows best practices:\n- Single source of truth for SFTP configuration\n- Skips .htaccess during sync to preserve server configuration\n- Removes problematic HTML attributes that can cause CSP issues\n- Includes SEO optimizations for better search visibility\n- Supports Spanish language for broader audience reach","partial":false},{"ts":1745379144639,"type":"ask","ask":"completion_result","text":""},{"ts":1745379547108,"type":"say","say":"user_feedback","text":"npx sftp-deploy","images":[]},{"ts":1745379547188,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"request\":\"[attempt_completion] Result:\\n\\nThe user has provided feedback on the results.

SFTP Configuration Standardization\n- ‚úÖ Set `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json` as the single source of truth\n- ‚úÖ Added `.htaccess` to ignore list to prevent overwriting server configuration\n\n## 2. HTML Cleanup for Deployment\n- ‚úÖ Removed all `integrity=\"...\"` attributes from HTML files\n- ‚úÖ Removed `X-Frame-Options` meta tags from HTML files\n- ‚úÖ Added SEO and Open Graph meta tags for better search visibility\n\n## 3. Spanish Language Support\n- ‚úÖ Verified `locales/es/` directory exists with translation files\n- ‚úÖ Added language selector toggle to header\n- ‚úÖ Added language detection from browser settings\n- ‚úÖ Added `lang=\"en\"` attribute with dynamic updating\n- ‚úÖ Added `<meta name=\"language\" content=\"en, es\">` tag\n- ‚úÖ Created language-switcher.js for toggling between languages\n\n## 4. Deployment Options\nCreated multiple deployment methods to ensure flexibility:\n\n1. **VS Code SFTP Extension** (Primary Method)\n   - Created detailed guides: `docs/sftp-upload-guide.md` and `docs/sftp-visual-guide.html`\n\n2. **NPM Package Deployment**\n   - Installed `sftp-deploy` package\n   - Created `sftp-config.json` configuration file\n   - Created `scripts/sftp-deploy.sh` deployment script\n\n3. **Native SFTP Command**\n   - Created `scripts/native-sftp-deploy.sh` for direct SFTP deployment\n\n## How to Deploy\nRun one of the following commands:\n\n```bash\n# Option 1: Use VS Code SFTP Extension (recommended)\n# Follow the guide in docs/sftp-upload-guide.md\n\n# Option 2: Use the sftp-deploy npm package\n./scripts/sftp-deploy.sh\n\n# Option 3: Use native SFTP command\n./scripts/native-sftp-deploy.sh\n```\n\nThe deployment process now follows best practices:\n- Single source of truth for SFTP configuration\n- Skips .htaccess during sync to preserve server configuration\n- Removes problematic HTML attributes that can cause CSP issues\n- Includes SEO optimizations for better search visibility\n- Supports Spanish language for broader audience reach","partial":false},{"ts":1745379915528,"type":"ask","ask":"completion_result","text":""},{"ts":1745379950076,"type":"say","say":"user_feedback","text":"# Option 1: Use VS Code SFTP Extension (recommended)\n# Follow the guide in docs/sftp-upload-guide.md","images":[]},{"ts":1745379950154,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"request\":\"[attempt_completion] Result:\\n\\nThe user has provided feedback on the results.

SFTP Configuration Standardization\n- ‚úÖ Set `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json` as the single source of truth\n- ‚úÖ Added `.htaccess` to ignore list to prevent overwriting server configuration\n\n## 2. HTML Cleanup for Deployment\n- ‚úÖ Removed all `integrity=\"...\"` attributes from HTML files\n- ‚úÖ Removed `X-Frame-Options` meta tags from HTML files\n- ‚úÖ Added SEO and Open Graph meta tags for better search visibility\n\n## 3. Spanish Language Support\n- ‚úÖ Verified `locales/es/` directory exists with translation files\n- ‚úÖ Added language selector toggle to header\n- ‚úÖ Added language detection from browser settings\n- ‚úÖ Added `lang=\"en\"` attribute with dynamic updating\n- ‚úÖ Added `<meta name=\"language\" content=\"en, es\">` tag\n- ‚úÖ Created language-switcher.js for toggling between languages\n\n## 4. Deployment Process\n\nI've set up the VS Code SFTP Extension as the primary deployment method with detailed guides:\n\n1. **Install the SFTP Extension** (by @Natizyskunk)\n\n2. **Save All Files and Restart VS Code**\n   - Added this critical step to ensure configuration changes are applied\n   - Press `Ctrl+K S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+K S` (Mac) to save all files\n   - Restart VS Code completely\n\n3. **Upload the Folder**\n   - Right-click on the `dist` folder\n   - Select `SFTP: Upload Folder`\n   - Confirm the remote path: `/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app`\n\n4. **Verify the Deployment**\n   - Visit https://aisportsedge.app in incognito mode\n   - Check for no reload loops, no CSP errors, and working Firebase auth\n   - Test the Spanish language toggle functionality\n\n## 5. Alternative Deployment Methods\n\nCreated multiple deployment options as fallbacks:\n\n1. **NPM Package Deployment**\n   - Installed `sftp-deploy` package\n   - Created `sftp-config.json` configuration file\n   - Created `scripts/sftp-deploy.sh` deployment script\n\n2. **Native SFTP Command**\n   - Created `scripts/native-sftp-deploy.sh` for direct SFTP deployment\n\n## 6. Documentation\n\nCreated comprehensive documentation:\n- `docs/sftp-upload-guide.md` - Text-based instructions\n- `docs/sftp-visual-guide.html` - Visual step-by-step guide\n\nThe deployment process now follows best practices:\n- Single source of truth for SFTP configuration\n- Skips .htaccess during sync to preserve server configuration\n- Removes problematic HTML attributes that can cause CSP issues\n- Includes SEO optimizations for better search visibility\n- Supports Spanish language for broader audience reach","partial":false},{"ts":1745381421840,"type":"ask","ask":"completion_result","text":""}]
