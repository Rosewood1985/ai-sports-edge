Open VS Code Explorer View\n- Press `Ctrl+Shift+E` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+E` (Mac) to open the Explorer view\n- Navigate to the `dist` folder in your project\n\n### 2. Upload the Folder\n- Right-click on the `dist` folder\n- From the context menu, select `SFTP: Upload Folder`\n- A confirmation dialog will appear showing the remote path: `/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app`\n- Click `Upload` to start the transfer\n\n### 3. Monitor Upload Progress\n- The VS Code status bar will show the upload progress\n- Wait for the \"Upload complete\" notification\n\n### 4. Verify the Deployment\n- Open a new incognito/private browser window\n- Visit https://aisportsedge.app\n- Check for the following:\n  - No reload loops\n  - No integrity, MIME, or CSP errors in the browser console (F12 > Console)\n  - Firebase authentication works correctly\n  - Routing between pages works as expected\n  - Spanish language toggle appears and works correctly\n\n### 5. Test Spanish Language Support\n- Click the language toggle button in the navigation\n- Verify that text changes to Spanish\n- Test navigation and functionality in Spanish mode\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### If Files Are Not Uploading\n- Check the SFTP configuration in `.vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json`\n- Verify server credentials and connection settings\n- Try restarting VS Code\n\n### If X-Frame-Options or Integrity Issues Persist\n- Run the cleanup script again: `./scripts/deploy-without-htaccess.sh`\n- Check the HTML files manually for any remaining problematic tags\n\n### If Language Toggle Doesn't Appear\n- Verify that `language-switcher.js` is included in the HTML\n- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors\n\n## Next Steps\n- Consider setting up a GitHub Action for automated deployment\n- Document the deployment process in your team wiki\n- Schedule regular checks for CSP and security headers\n</content>\n<line_count>63</line_count>\n</write_to_file>"}],"ts":1745379078986},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"[write_to_file for 'docs/sftp-upload-guide.md'] Result:"},{"type":"text","text":"The content was successfully saved to docs/sftp-upload-guide.md."},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\ndocs/sftp-upload-guide.md\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nmigrate-betting-page.sh,migrate-settings-page.sh,deploy-atomic-to-production.sh,atomic-architecture-final-summary.md,push-final-summary.sh,.vscode/sftp.json,scripts/check-sftp-configs.sh,scripts/check-sftp-sync.sh,scripts/pre-deploy-checks.sh,scripts/quick-deploy.sh,docs/sftp-deployment.md,commit-message.txt,memory-bank/sftp-deployment-standardization.md,scripts/push-sftp-config-changes.sh,scripts/sftp-deploy-cleanup.sh,scripts/deployment-checklist.sh,dist/register-service-worker.js,dist/service-worker.js,commit-message-sw.txt,scripts/push-service-worker-changes.sh\n\n# Actively Running Terminals\n## Original command: `chmod +x scripts/push-csp-fix.sh`\n\n# Current Time\n4/22/2025, 11:31:20 PM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\n\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\n88,024 (44%)\n\n# Current Cost\n$14.88\n\n# Current Mode\n<slug>boomerang-mode</slug>\n<name>Boomerang Mode</name>\n<model>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</model>\n<role>You are operating in Boomerang Mode for the AI Sports Edge project.

SFTP Configuration Standardization\n- ‚úÖ Set `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json` as the single source of truth\n- ‚úÖ Added `.htaccess` to ignore list to prevent overwriting server configuration\n\n## 2. HTML Cleanup for Deployment\n- ‚úÖ Removed all `integrity=\"...\"` attributes from HTML files\n- ‚úÖ Removed `X-Frame-Options` meta tags from HTML files\n- ‚úÖ Added SEO and Open Graph meta tags for better search visibility\n\n## 3. Spanish Language Support\n- ‚úÖ Verified `locales/es/` directory exists with translation files\n- ‚úÖ Added language selector toggle to header\n- ‚úÖ Added language detection from browser settings\n- ‚úÖ Added `lang=\"en\"` attribute with dynamic updating\n- ‚úÖ Added `<meta name=\"language\" content=\"en, es\">` tag\n- ‚úÖ Created language-switcher.js for toggling between languages\n\n## 4. Deployment Automation\n- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive `scripts/deploy-without-htaccess.sh` script\n- ‚úÖ Successfully ran the script to prepare files for deployment\n- ‚úÖ Created detailed SFTP upload guides:\n  - `docs/sftp-upload-guide.md` - Text-based instructions\n  - `docs/sftp-visual-guide.html` - Visual step-by-step guide\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Complete the final deployment step by following the SFTP upload guide\n2. Verify the site works correctly at https://aisportsedge.app\n3. Test the Spanish language toggle functionality\n4. Check for any console errors related to CSP or integrity attributes\n\nThe deployment process now follows best practices:\n- Single source of truth for SFTP configuration\n- Skips .htaccess during sync to preserve server configuration\n- Removes problematic HTML attributes that can cause CSP issues\n- Includes SEO optimizations for better search visibility\n- Supports Spanish language for broader audience reach\n</result>\n</attempt_completion>"}],"ts":1745379144799},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"[attempt_completion] Result:"},{"type":"text","text":"The user has provided feedback on the results.

Now I need to provide a final completion message summarizing all the changes we've made.\n</thinking>\n\n<attempt_completion>\n<result>\n# SFTP Configuration & Deployment Optimization Complete ‚úÖ\n\nI've successfully implemented all requested optimizations for the deployment process:\n\n## 1. SFTP Configuration Standardization\n- ‚úÖ Set `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json` as the single source of truth\n- ‚úÖ Added `.htaccess` to ignore list to prevent overwriting server configuration\n\n## 2. HTML Cleanup for Deployment\n- ‚úÖ Removed all `integrity=\"...\"` attributes from HTML files\n- ‚úÖ Removed `X-Frame-Options` meta tags from HTML files\n- ‚úÖ Added SEO and Open Graph meta tags for better search visibility\n\n## 3. Spanish Language Support\n- ‚úÖ Verified `locales/es/` directory exists with translation files\n- ‚úÖ Added language selector toggle to header\n- ‚úÖ Added language detection from browser settings\n- ‚úÖ Added `lang=\"en\"` attribute with dynamic updating\n- ‚úÖ Added `<meta name=\"language\" content=\"en, es\">` tag\n- ‚úÖ Created language-switcher.js for toggling between languages\n\n## 4. Deployment Process\n\nI've set up the VS Code SFTP Extension as the primary deployment method with detailed guides:\n\n1. **Install the SFTP Extension** (by @Natizyskunk)\n\n2. **Save All Files and Restart VS Code**\n   - Added this critical step to ensure configuration changes are applied\n   - Press `Ctrl+K S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+K S` (Mac) to save all files\n   - Restart VS Code completely\n\n3. **Upload the Folder**\n   - Right-click on the `dist` folder\n   - Select `SFTP: Upload Folder`\n   - Confirm the remote path: `/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app`\n\n4. **Verify the Deployment**\n   - Visit https://aisportsedge.app in incognito mode\n   - Check for no reload loops, no CSP errors, and working Firebase auth\n   - Test the Spanish language toggle functionality\n\n## 5. Alternative Deployment Methods\n\nCreated multiple deployment options as fallbacks:\n\n1. **NPM Package Deployment**\n   - Installed `sftp-deploy` package\n   - Created `sftp-config.json` configuration file\n   - Created `scripts/sftp-deploy.sh` deployment script\n\n2. **Native SFTP Command**\n   - Created `scripts/native-sftp-deploy.sh` for direct SFTP deployment\n\n## 6. Documentation\n\nCreated comprehensive documentation:\n- `docs/sftp-upload-guide.md` - Text-based instructions\n- `docs/sftp-visual-guide.html` - Visual step-by-step guide\n\nThe deployment process now follows best practices:\n- Single source of truth for SFTP configuration\n- Skips .htaccess during sync to preserve server configuration\n- Removes problematic HTML attributes that can cause CSP issues\n- Includes SEO optimizations for better search visibility\n- Supports Spanish language for broader audience reach\n</result>\n</attempt_completion>"}],"ts":1745381422004}]
