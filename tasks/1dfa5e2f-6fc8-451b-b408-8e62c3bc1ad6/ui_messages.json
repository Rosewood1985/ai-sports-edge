Defines supported languages (currently 'en' and 'es')\n2. Imports translation files\n3. Provides functions to detect device language\n4. Manages language state and persistence using AsyncStorage\n5. Provides translation functions with fallback mechanisms\n6. Provides formatting functions for numbers, currencies, and dates\n7. Exposes a context provider (I18nProvider) and a custom hook (useI18n)\n\n## Spanish Testing Infrastructure\n\nThe app includes a comprehensive testing infrastructure for Spanish language functionality:\n\n1. **Test Runner**: `__tests__/run-spanish-tests.js`\n   - Runs Spanish language tests using Jest\n   - Collects test results and generates a summary\n   - Writes the summary to a markdown file\n\n2. **Test Documentation**: `__tests__/spanish-tests-documentation.md`\n   - Provides information about the Spanish language testing\n   - Describes test files, how to run tests, and test coverage\n   - Includes best practices for internationalization\n\n3. **Test Implementation**: `__tests__/i18n/spanish-language-test.js`\n   - Contains tests for various screens and components\n   - Verifies that Spanish translations are displayed correctly\n   - Tests language switching functionality\n\nThe tests cover key areas of the app:\n- Login Screens\n- Home Screen\n- Enhanced Analytics Dashboard\n- Betting Slip Import\n- Language Switching\n\n## Potential Architectural Issues and Improvement Areas\n\nBased on my analysis, I've identified several potential areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Test Execution Status**: The Spanish testing summary indicates that no tests have been run yet. This suggests that the testing infrastructure might not be regularly used or integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.\n\n2. **Limited Language Support**: The app currently only supports English and Spanish. The architecture is designed to support more languages, but the implementation is limited to these two.\n\n3. **Modular Translation Files**: While the app uses separate files for feature-specific translations (like odds-comparison), this approach might lead to inconsistencies if not properly managed. There's no clear mechanism for merging these translations.\n\n4. **RTL Support**: The I18nContext includes RTL (Right-to-Left) support, but it's not being used for Spanish or English. If the app plans to support RTL languages in the future, more testing would be needed.\n\n5. **Fallback Mechanism**: The translation function includes a fallback to English when a translation is missing, but there's no system to report or track missing translations.\n\n6. **Language Detection**: The language detection relies on platform-specific APIs, which might not be consistent across all platforms."},{"ts":1744843895027,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"request\":\"[new_task in Architect mode: 'Analyze the Spanish language implementation in the AI Sports Edge app. Your task is to:\\n\\n1.
