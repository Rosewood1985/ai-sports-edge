excellent planner. Your goal is to gather information and get context to create a detailed plan for accomplishing the user's task, which the user will review and approve before they switch into another mode to implement the solution.</role>\n<custom_instructions>\n====\n\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.\n\nLanguage Preference:\nYou should always speak and think in the \"English\" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\n\nGlobal Instructions:\nYou are assisting with the development of AI Sports Edge, a React Native (Expo) app using atomic architecture. The codebase lives in VS Code, follows a modular design, and is managed in a private GitHub repo. Prettier is used for formatting. Firebase and Stripe are integrated, and the app is deployed via SFTP to GoDaddy (aisportsedge.app).\n\nYour responsibilities include:\n\nüìê Code Architecture\n\nBuild and refactor components following atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms).\n\nMaintain clean, modular, and scalable folder structures.\n\nAuto-format with Prettier unless directed otherwise.\n\nüßπ Code Quality\n\nEliminate dead code, redundant imports, and logic bloat.\n\nWatch for performance hits, logic gaps, or layout inconsistencies.\n\nPreserve logic from previous iterations unless redesigning is requested.\n\nüìã Workflow Support\n\nTrack ongoing to-do list updates based on code changes or new issues.\n\nSupport Git workflows: staging, branching, commit writing, and resolving merge conflicts.\n\nüåç Spanish Language Support\n\nTranslate UI labels, notifications, and region-specific elements (e.g., decimal odds).\n\nSupport English ‚Üî Spanish toggling and auto-detection logic.\n\nEnsure Spanish versions are stylistically consistent.\n\nüöÄ Deployment\n\nHelp prep builds and deploy via SFTP.\n\nTroubleshoot 500 errors, CSP/meta tag issues, Firebase env loading, and .htaccess conflicts.\n\nRecommend GitHub Actions pipelines or equivalent automation.\n\nEnsure SEO best practices (meta tags, sitemap, page load optimization) are followed.\n\nü§ù Collaboration Style\n\nOperate like an embedded AI dev on the team‚Äîfast, accurate, and low-friction.\n\nUse code blocks, file paths, and bullet points to enhance clarity.\n\nFlag anything that needs comments, documentation, or architectural alignment.\n\nMode-specific Instructions:\n1.

This guide will walk you through the installation and setup process.\n 5 | \n 6 | ## Installation Steps\n 7 | \n 8 | ### 1. Open VS Code Extensions Panel\n 9 | - Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window\n10 | - Or use the keyboard shortcut:\n11 |   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+X`\n12 |   - macOS: `Cmd+Shift+X`\n13 | \n14 | ### 2. Search for SFTP\n15 | - Type \"SFTP\" in the search box\n16 | - Look for \"SFTP\" by Natizyskunk (not the older one by liximomo which is deprecated)\n17 | \n18 | ### 3. Install the Extension\n19 | - Click the \"Install\" button next to the SFTP extension\n20 | \n21 | ![VS Code SFTP Extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Natizyskunk/vscode-sftp/master/assets/logo.png)\n22 | \n23 | ### 4. Reload VS Code\n24 | - After installation, you may need to reload VS Code\n25 | - Click the \"Reload\" button if prompted\n26 | \n27 | ## Configuration\n28 | The `.vscode/sftp.json` file has already been created with your SFTP credentials:\n29 | \n30 | ```json\n31 | {\n32 |   \"host\": \"sftp.aisportsedge.app\",\n33 |   \"port\": 22,\n34 |   \"username\": \"deploy@aisportsedge.app\",\n35 |   \"password\": \"hTQ3LQ]#P(b,\",\n36 |   \"remotePath\": \"/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app/deploy\",\n37 |   \"protocol\": \"sftp\",\n38 |   \"uploadOnSave\": true\n39 | }\n40 | ```\n41 | \n42 | ## Using the Extension\n43 | \n44 | ### Uploading Files\n45 | 1. Right-click on a file in the Explorer panel\n46 | 2. Select \"SFTP: Upload\" from the context menu\n47 | 3. The file will be uploaded to the remote path specified in your configuration\n48 | \n49 | ### Keyboard Shortcuts\n50 | - Upload current file: `Ctrl+Alt+U` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+U` (macOS)\n51 | - Upload selected files: Select multiple files, right-click, and choose \"SFTP: Upload\"\n52 | \n53 | ### Automatic Upload\n54 | With `\"uploadOnSave\": true` in your configuration, files will automatically be uploaded whenever you save them.\n55 | \n56 | ## Troubleshooting\n57 | \n58 | ### Connection Issues\n59 | - Verify your SFTP credentials are correct\n60 | - Check if the server is accessible from your network\n61 | - Ensure the remote path exists on the server\n62 | \n63 | ### Permission Issues\n64 | - Check if your user has write permissions to the remote directory\n65 | - Try changing the permissions of the remote directory if needed\n66 | \n67 | ### Extension Not Working\n68 | - Check the Output panel in VS Code for SFTP logs\n69 | - Select \"SFTP\" from the dropdown in the Output panel\n70 | - Look for error messages that might indicate the issue\n71 | \n72 | ## Additional Resources\n73 | - [VS Code SFTP Extension Documentation](https://github.com/Natizyskunk/vscode-sftp)\n74 | - [VS Code Extensions Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)\n</content>\n</file>"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\nscripts/deploy-scp.sh\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nvscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json,scripts/README.md,docs/sftp-upload-guide.md,commit-message-sftp-security.txt,scripts/push-sftp-security-fix.sh,scripts/test-secure-deploy.sh,commit-message-deployment-fixes.txt,scripts/push-deployment-fixes.sh,commit-message-changelog.txt,scripts/push-changelog.sh,fix-frontend-blockers.md,commit-message-final-frontend-fixes.txt,scripts/push-final-frontend-fixes.sh,final-frontend-fixes.md,commit-message-health-check.txt,scripts/push-health-check.sh,docs/deployment-health-check.md,CHANGELOG.md,commit-message-changelog-update.txt,scripts/push-changelog-update.sh\n\n# Actively Running Terminals\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\n\n# Current Time\n4/23/2025, 11:29:43 AM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\n\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\n148,599 (74%)\n\n# Current Cost\n$9.47\n\n# Current Mode\n<slug>architect</slug>\n<name>Architect</name>\n<model>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</model>\n<role>You are Roo, an experienced technical leader who is inquisitive and an excellent planner.

The codebase lives in VS Code, follows a modular design, and is managed in a private GitHub repo. Prettier is used for formatting. Firebase and Stripe are integrated, and the app is deployed via SFTP to GoDaddy (aisportsedge.app).\n\nYour responsibilities include:\n\nüìê Code Architecture\n\nBuild and refactor components following atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms).\n\nMaintain clean, modular, and scalable folder structures.\n\nAuto-format with Prettier unless directed otherwise.\n\nüßπ Code Quality\n\nEliminate dead code, redundant imports, and logic bloat.\n\nWatch for performance hits, logic gaps, or layout inconsistencies.\n\nPreserve logic from previous iterations unless redesigning is requested.\n\nüìã Workflow Support\n\nTrack ongoing to-do list updates based on code changes or new issues.\n\nSupport Git workflows: staging, branching, commit writing, and resolving merge conflicts.\n\nüåç Spanish Language Support\n\nTranslate UI labels, notifications, and region-specific elements (e.g., decimal odds).\n\nSupport English ‚Üî Spanish toggling and auto-detection logic.\n\nEnsure Spanish versions are stylistically consistent.\n\nüöÄ Deployment\n\nHelp prep builds and deploy via SFTP.\n\nTroubleshoot 500 errors, CSP/meta tag issues, Firebase env loading, and .htaccess conflicts.\n\nRecommend GitHub Actions pipelines or equivalent automation.\n\nEnsure SEO best practices (meta tags, sitemap, page load optimization) are followed.\n\nü§ù Collaboration Style\n\nOperate like an embedded AI dev on the team‚Äîfast, accurate, and low-friction.\n\nUse code blocks, file paths, and bullet points to enhance clarity.\n\nFlag anything that needs comments, documentation, or architectural alignment.\n\nMode-specific Instructions:\n1. Do some information gathering (for example using read_file or search_files) to get more context about the task.\n\n2. You should also ask the user clarifying questions to get a better understanding of the task.\n\n3. Once you've gained more context about the user's request, you should create a detailed plan for how to accomplish the task. Include Mermaid diagrams if they help make your plan clearer.\n\n4. Ask the user if they are pleased with this plan, or if they would like to make any changes. Think of this as a brainstorming session where you can discuss the task and plan the best way to accomplish it.\n\n5. Once the user confirms the plan, ask them if they'd like you to write it to a markdown file.\n\n6.

Let me outline a comprehensive plan to fix these issues.\n\n## Current Situation Analysis\n\n1. **Extension Status**: You've recently downloaded Natizyskunk's SFTP extension\n2. **Configuration Location**: There's a configuration file at `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json`\n3. **Issue**: The \"Upload Folder\" command is missing from the context menu\n4. **Goal**: Enable reliable SFTP-based uploads to `/public_html/aisportsedge.app/`\n\n## Root Causes & Solutions\n\nThe issues are likely caused by:\n1. Configuration file in the wrong location\n2. Incorrect configuration format for the Natizyskunk extension\n3. Missing debug logging to identify specific issues\n4. VS Code might need to be restarted after configuration changes\n\n## Detailed Implementation Plan\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Identify Installed SFTP Extension] --> B[Verify Extension Configuration]\n    B --> C[Create Proper Config File]\n    C --> D[Enable Debug Logging]\n    D --> E[Restart VS Code]\n    E --> F[Test SFTP Commands]\n    F --> G[Verify Deployment]\n```\n\n### Phase 1: Identify & Verify Extension\n\n1. **Confirm Extension Details**\n   - Check the exact extension ID and version\n   - Verify it's properly installed and activated\n   - Review the extension's documentation for correct configuration format\n\n2. **Examine Current Configuration**\n   - Check if the configuration is in the correct location\n   - Verify the configuration format matches what the extension expects\n\n### Phase 2: Create Proper Configuration\n\n1. **Create `.vscode/sftp.json` in Project Root**\n   - This is the standard location where the extension looks for configuration\n   - Use the correct format for Natizyskunk's extension\n\n2. **Configure with Proper Settings**\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"AI Sports Edge\",\n     \"host\": \"aisportsedge.app\",\n     \"protocol\": \"sftp\",\n     \"port\": 22,\n     \"username\": \"deploy\",\n     \"password\": \"hTQ3LQ]#P(b,\",\n     \"remotePath\": \"/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app\",\n     \"uploadOnSave\": false,\n     \"ignore\": [\".vscode\", \".git\", \".DS_Store\", \"node_modules\"],\n     \"context\": \"./build\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Key Configuration Changes**\n   - Set `context` to `./build` to specify the local folder to upload\n   - Ensure `remotePath` points to the correct destination\n   - Set `uploadOnSave` to `false` to prevent automatic uploads\n\n### Phase 3: Enable Debug Logging\n\n1. **Add Debug Settings to VS Code**\n   - Add to VS Code settings.json:\n   ```json\n   \"sftp.debug\": true\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Output Panel**\n   - Open Output panel (View > Output)\n   - Select \"SFTP\" from the dropdown\n   - Monitor for error messages during operations\n\n### Phase 4: Test & Verify\n\n1. **Restart VS Code**\n   - Completely close and reopen VS Code\n   - This ensures all configuration changes are applied\n\n2. **Test SFTP Commands**\n   - Press Cmd+Shift+P to open command palette\n   - Search for \"SFTP: Upload\"\n   - Try both \"SFTP: Upload Active File\" and \"SFTP: Upload Folder\"\n\n3. **Verify Deployment**\n   - Check if files are properly uploaded to the server\n   - Verify the website works correctly after deployment\n\n## Fallback Options\n\nIf the above steps don't resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Alternative Command Usage**\n   - Use command palette (Cmd+Shift+P) instead of context menu\n   - Try \"SFTP: Upload Folder\" from the command palette\n\n2. **Alternative Extension**\n   - Consider installing a different SFTP extension if Natizyskunk's doesn't work\n   - Options include \"SFTP\" by liximomo (older but stable) or \"Remote - SSH\" by Microsoft\n\n3. **CLI-Based Deployment**\n   - Use the existing script-based deployment as a fallback\n   - Modify the scripts to use environment variables for credentials\n\n## Does this plan address your needs?

Configuration file in the wrong location\n2. Incorrect configuration format for the Natizyskunk extension\n3. Missing debug logging to identify specific issues\n4. VS Code might need to be restarted after configuration changes\n\n## Detailed Implementation Plan\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Identify Installed SFTP Extension] --> B[Verify Extension Configuration]\n    B --> C[Create Proper Config File]\n    C --> D[Enable Debug Logging]\n    D --> E[Restart VS Code]\n    E --> F[Test SFTP Commands]\n    F --> G[Verify Deployment]\n```\n\n### Phase 1: Identify & Verify Extension\n\n1. **Confirm Extension Details**\n   - Check the exact extension ID and version\n   - Verify it's properly installed and activated\n   - Review the extension's documentation for correct configuration format\n\n2. **Examine Current Configuration**\n   - Check if the configuration is in the correct location\n   - Verify the configuration format matches what the extension expects\n\n### Phase 2: Create Proper Configuration\n\n1. **Create `.vscode/sftp.json` in Project Root**\n   - This is the standard location where the extension looks for configuration\n   - Use the correct format for Natizyskunk's extension\n\n2. **Configure with Proper Settings**\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"AI Sports Edge\",\n     \"host\": \"aisportsedge.app\",\n     \"protocol\": \"sftp\",\n     \"port\": 22,\n     \"username\": \"deploy\",\n     \"password\": \"hTQ3LQ]#P(b,\",\n     \"remotePath\": \"/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app\",\n     \"uploadOnSave\": false,\n     \"ignore\": [\".vscode\", \".git\", \".DS_Store\", \"node_modules\"],\n     \"context\": \"./build\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Key Configuration Changes**\n   - Set `context` to `./build` to specify the local folder to upload\n   - Ensure `remotePath` points to the correct destination\n   - Set `uploadOnSave` to `false` to prevent automatic uploads\n\n### Phase 3: Enable Debug Logging\n\n1. **Add Debug Settings to VS Code**\n   - Add to VS Code settings.json:\n   ```json\n   \"sftp.debug\": true\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Output Panel**\n   - Open Output panel (View > Output)\n   - Select \"SFTP\" from the dropdown\n   - Monitor for error messages during operations\n\n### Phase 4: Test & Verify\n\n1. **Restart VS Code**\n   - Completely close and reopen VS Code\n   - This ensures all configuration changes are applied\n\n2. **Test SFTP Commands**\n   - Press Cmd+Shift+P to open command palette\n   - Search for \"SFTP: Upload\"\n   - Try both \"SFTP: Upload Active File\" and \"SFTP: Upload Folder\"\n\n3. **Verify Deployment**\n   - Check if files are properly uploaded to the server\n   - Verify the website works correctly after deployment\n\n## Fallback Options\n\nIf the above steps don't resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Alternative Command Usage**\n   - Use command palette (Cmd+Shift+P) instead of context menu\n   - Try \"SFTP: Upload Folder\" from the command palette\n\n2. **Alternative Extension**\n   - Consider installing a different SFTP extension if Natizyskunk's doesn't work\n   - Options include \"SFTP\" by liximomo (older but stable) or \"Remote - SSH\" by Microsoft\n\n3. **CLI-Based Deployment**\n   - Use the existing script-based deployment as a fallback\n   - Modify the scripts to use environment variables for credentials\n</content>\n<line_count>107</line_count>\n</write_to_file>"}],"ts":1745422349918},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"[write_to_file for 'docs/sftp-deployment-fix-plan.md'] Result:"},{"type":"text","text":"The content was successfully saved to docs/sftp-deployment-fix-plan.md."},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\ndocs/sftp-deployment-fix-plan.md\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nvscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json,scripts/README.md,docs/sftp-upload-guide.md,commit-message-sftp-security.txt,scripts/push-sftp-security-fix.sh,scripts/test-secure-deploy.sh,commit-message-deployment-fixes.txt,scripts/push-deployment-fixes.sh,commit-message-changelog.txt,scripts/push-changelog.sh,fix-frontend-blockers.md,commit-message-final-frontend-fixes.txt,scripts/push-final-frontend-fixes.sh,final-frontend-fixes.md,commit-message-health-check.txt,scripts/push-health-check.sh,docs/deployment-health-check.md,CHANGELOG.md,commit-message-changelog-update.txt,scripts/push-changelog-update.sh\n\n# Actively Running Terminals\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\n\n# Current Time\n4/23/2025, 11:32:31 AM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\n\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\n170,475 (85%)\n\n# Current Cost\n$9.92\n\n# Current Mode\n<slug>architect</slug>\n<name>Architect</name>\n<model>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</model>\n<role>You are Roo, an experienced technical leader who is inquisitive and an excellent planner.
