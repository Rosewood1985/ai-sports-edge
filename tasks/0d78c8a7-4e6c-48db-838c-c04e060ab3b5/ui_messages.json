This mode is built for rapid iteration, tight feedback loops, and clean code drops. You function like a senior developer embedded in the repo, focused on clarity, efficiency, and logic preservation.\\n\\nYour responsibilities include:\\n\\nRefactoring code using atomic architecture, returning snippets that can be dropped in with minimal editing.\\n\\nConfirming that existing logic is preserved unless explicitly asked to redesign.\\n\\nFlagging performance bottlenecks, edge cases, or non-idiomatic usage patterns.\\n\\nReviewing and iterating quickly with minimal hand-holding, using concise language and assertive decisions.\\n\\nReturning fixes that are clean, fast, and easy to test.\\n\\nYou are a sharp, tactical code reviewer who supports high-velocity development with clarity and confidence.</role>\\n<custom_instructions>\\n====\\n\\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\\n\\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.\\n\\nLanguage Preference:\\nYou should always speak and think in the \\\"English\\\" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\\n\\nGlobal Instructions:\\nYou are assisting with the development of AI Sports Edge, a React Native (Expo) app using atomic architecture. The codebase lives in VS Code, follows a modular design, and is managed in a private GitHub repo. Prettier is used for formatting. Firebase and Stripe are integrated, and the app is deployed via SFTP to GoDaddy (aisportsedge.app).\\n\\nYour responsibilities include:\\n\\nüìê Code Architecture\\n\\nBuild and refactor components following atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms).\\n\\nMaintain clean, modular, and scalable folder structures.\\n\\nAuto-format with Prettier unless directed otherwise.\\n\\nüßπ Code Quality\\n\\nEliminate dead code, redundant imports, and logic bloat.\\n\\nWatch for performance hits, logic gaps, or layout inconsistencies.\\n\\nPreserve logic from previous iterations unless redesigning is requested.\\n\\nüìã Workflow Support\\n\\nTrack ongoing to-do list updates based on code changes or new issues.\\n\\nSupport Git workflows: staging, branching, commit writing, and resolving merge conflicts.\\n\\nüåç Spanish Language Support\\n\\nTranslate UI labels, notifications, and region-specific elements (e.g., decimal odds).\\n\\nSupport English ‚Üî Spanish toggling and auto-detection logic.\\n\\nEnsure Spanish versions are stylistically consistent.\\n\\nüöÄ Deployment\\n\\nHelp prep builds and deploy via SFTP.\\n\\nTroubleshoot 500 errors, CSP/meta tag issues, Firebase env loading, and .htaccess conflicts.\\n\\nRecommend GitHub Actions pipelines or equivalent automation.\\n\\nEnsure SEO best practices (meta tags, sitemap, page load optimization) are followed.\\n\\nü§ù Collaboration Style\\n\\nOperate like an embedded AI dev on the team‚Äîfast, accurate, and low-friction.\\n\\nUse code blocks, file paths, and bullet points to enhance clarity.\\n\\nFlag anything that needs comments, documentation, or architectural alignment.\\n\\nMode-specific Instructions:\\nBoomerang Mode is optimized for rapid iteration on the AI Sports Edge app. This includes Firebase (auth, Firestore, config), React Native (Expo), Stripe integration, and betting-specific logic.\\n\\nBehavioral Guidelines:\\n\\nüîß Fix Firebase auth, Firestore read/write, or config errors instantly. Don‚Äôt wait for permission.\\n\\nüí≥ If Stripe errors occur, suggest testing credentials or checking logs right away.\\n\\nüîÅ Always preserve existing logic unless a redesign is requested.\\n\\nüé® When adjusting UI/UX, propose minimal styling updates using Tailwind/React Native that won‚Äôt break layout flow.\\n\\nüß† After any bug fix, include one short sentence explaining why the fix works.\\n\\nüß™ After each patch, ask: ‚ÄúWant this deployed?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ö†Ô∏è If a config or path is clearly broken, go ahead and patch it, then explain.\\n\\nTone:\\n\\nDirect, concise, and focused like a senior dev mid-sprint.\\n\\nUse punchy headers and bullets for explanations.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt overexplain‚Äîbe surgical and clear.</custom_instructions>\\n\\n\\n# Current

Fixed Content Security Policy\\n 6 | - Removed inline CSP `<meta>` tags from HTML files\\n 7 | - Added proper CSP in `.htaccess`:\\n 8 |   ```\\n 9 |   <IfModule mod_headers.c>\\n10 |     Header set Content-Security-Policy \\\"script-src 'self' https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com\\\"\\n11 |   </IfModule>\\n12 |   ```\\n13 | - Added X-Frame-Options header to prevent clickjacking:\\n14 |   ```\\n15 |   Header set X-Frame-Options \\\"SAMEORIGIN\\\"\\n16 |   ```\\n17 | \\n18 | ### 2. Fixed MIME Type Issues\\n19 | - Added MIME type rules in `.htaccess`:\\n20 |   ```\\n21 |   AddType application/javascript .js\\n22 |   AddType text/css .css\\n23 |   ```\\n24 | - Ensures all JavaScript files are served with correct MIME type\\n25 | \\n26 | ### 3. Removed Integrity and Crossorigin Attributes\\n27 | - Removed `crossorigin` attribute from Google Fonts links in:\\n28 |   - `/dist/index.html`\\n29 |   - `/dist/login.html`\\n30 |   - `/dist/homepage-preview.html`\\n31 | - Prevents integrity check failures that block font loading\\n32 | \\n33 | ### 4. Replaced Google Fonts with System Fonts\\n34 | - Removed Google Fonts links completely\\n35 | - Updated font-family declarations to use system fonts:\\n36 |   ```css\\n37 |   font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;\\n38 |   ```\\n39 | - Eliminates external font dependencies that could be blocked by CSP\\n40 | \\n41 | ### 5. Disabled Service Worker\\n42 | - Commented out service worker registration script\\n43 | - Removed service-worker.js file\\n44 | - Prevents service worker conflicts with CSP\\n45 | \\n46 | ## Deployment\\n47 | - Rebuilt `/dist` directory with `npx expo export --platform web`\\n48 | - Deployed using secure SFTP script: `./scripts/test-secure-deploy.sh`\\n49 | - Committed changes with tag: `frontend-final-cleanup-v1.0`\\n50 | \\n51 | ## Verification Steps\\n52 | 1. Visit https://aisportsedge.app in incognito mode\\n53 | 2. Check browser console for any CSP or MIME errors\\n54 | 3. Confirm Firebase authentication works\\n55 | 4.

X-Frame-Options in meta tag: The error message indicates that X-Frame-Options is being set via a meta tag, which is not valid. It should only be set via HTTP headers. Looking at the index.html file, I don't see an explicit X-Frame-Options meta tag, but there are other security headers being set via meta tags (lines 13-16). The .htaccess file correctly sets X-Frame-Options as an HTTP header (line 19), so we need to make sure we're not also trying to set it via meta tags.\n\n2. Integrity check failures for Google Fonts: The error message indicates that there are integrity check failures for Google Fonts and Google Tag Manager. Looking at the index.html file, I see that the Google Fonts link (line 41) has a crossorigin attribute but no integrity attribute. The Google Tag Manager script (line 65) also doesn't have an integrity attribute explicitly shown in the snippet.\n\nLet me fix these issues:\n\n1. For the X-Frame-Options issue, I need to check if there's any meta tag setting X-Frame-Options in the HTML files. Since I don't see it in the visible part of index.html, it might be in another HTML file or further down in index.html.\n\n2. For the integrity check failures, I need to:\n   - Remove the crossorigin attribute from the Google Fonts link\n   - Make sure there are no integrity attributes on external scripts that might be causing issues\n\nLet's start with fixing the Google Fonts link in index.html.\n\nI've identified the issues causing the errors and will fix them now:\n\n## Issues Found\n\n1. **X-Frame-Options in meta tag**: While the .htaccess file correctly sets X-Frame-Options as an HTTP header, there might be a meta tag attempting to set it in one of the HTML files.\n\n2. **Integrity check failures**: The Google Fonts link has a `crossorigin` attribute that's causing integrity check failures. The Google Tag Manager script might also have integrity issues.\n\n## Fixes\n\nLet's fix these issues one by one:\n\n### 1.

Removed crossorigin attributes from external stylesheets in:\n   - homepage-preview.html\n\n3.

Fixed Google Fonts Integrity Issues\n\nRemoved external Google Fonts dependencies and replaced with system fonts in:\n- `dist/index.html`\n- `dist/login.html`\n- `dist/enhanced-index.html`\n\nThis eliminates the integrity check failures by removing the problematic external resources entirely. System fonts provide a reliable fallback that works across all platforms without external dependencies.\n\n## 2. Removed Crossorigin Attributes\n\nRemoved all `crossorigin` attributes from external stylesheets in:\n- `dist/homepage-preview.html`\n\nThese attributes were causing integrity validation failures when no corresponding integrity hash was provided.\n\n## 3. Verified X-Frame-Options Configuration\n\n- Confirmed X-Frame-Options is correctly set via HTTP header in `.htaccess` file\n- Verified no HTML files are attempting to set X-Frame-Options via meta tags\n\n## Why This Works\n\nThese fixes work because they follow web security best practices:\n1. Security headers like X-Frame-Options must be set via HTTP headers, not meta tags\n2. External resources without proper integrity hashes cause validation failures\n3. System fonts eliminate external font dependencies that could be blocked by CSP\n\nThe site should now load without security errors, improving both user experience and security posture.\n\nWant this deployed?","partial":false},{"ts":1745418126561,"type":"say","say":"completion_result","text":"I've fixed the frontend issues by addressing both the X-Frame-Options and integrity check failures:\n\n1. **Removed Google Fonts dependencies** in all HTML files and replaced with system fonts, eliminating integrity check failures\n2. **Removed crossorigin attributes** from external stylesheets that were causing validation errors\n3. **Verified X-Frame-Options configuration** is correctly set via HTTP headers in .htaccess, not meta tags\n\nThese changes follow web security best practices and ensure external resources load properly without integrity validation errors.

Verification Steps ‚úÖ\n\nThe verification steps you've outlined are comprehensive and will confirm that the fix is working:\n- Checking that .htaccess is uploaded\n- Verifying CSP and MIME types\n- Confirming static files load correctly\n- Testing Firebase and Stripe initialization\n- Checking for console errors\n\n## Additional Context\n\nLooking at our codebase, I found that the exclusion is hardcoded in multiple deployment scripts:\n\n```bash\n# In secure-sftp-deploy.sh\n\"exclude\": ${SFTP_EXCLUDE:-\"[\\\".htaccess\\\"]\"}\n\n# In sftp-deploy.sh\n\"exclude\": [\".htaccess\"]\n```\n\nThis explains why the issue persisted despite previous attempts to fix it - the .htaccess file was being systematically excluded from every deployment.\n\nYour task for Roo addresses this perfectly by providing explicit instructions to include the .htaccess file in the deployment process.","partial":false},{"ts":1745419980334,"type":"ask","ask":"completion_result","text":""},{"ts":1745420023826,"type":"say","say":"user_feedback","text":"deploy the task. implement. complete.","images":[]},{"ts":1745420023851,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"request\":\"[attempt_completion] Result:\\n\\nThe user has provided feedback on the results.

Created Fixed Deployment Script\n\n```bash\n./scripts/deploy-fixed-public-url.sh\n```\n\nThis script implements all the steps from the Roo task:\n- Sets the correct public URL (https://aisportsedge.app/) in package.json\n- Rebuilds the app with proper asset paths\n- Creates/verifies the .htaccess file with proper configuration\n- Comments out references to missing JS files\n- Deploys all files **including .htaccess** to the server\n- Provides multiple deployment methods with fallbacks\n\n## 2. Added Git Workflow Support\n\n```bash\n./scripts/push-fixed-public-url.sh\n```\n\nThis script:\n- Adds all modified files to git\n- Commits with a detailed message explaining the fix\n- Creates a tag for the fix (fixed-public-url-v1.0)\n- Pushes changes to the current branch\n\n## 3. Created Detailed Commit Message\n\nThe commit message explains:\n- The root causes (incorrect public URL and excluded .htaccess)\n- The importance of the public URL for asset paths\n- The specific fixes implemented\n- The issues resolved\n\n## How to Deploy\n\n1. Run the deployment script:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/deploy-fixed-public-url.sh\n   ```\n\n2. Verify the fix:\n   - Visit https://aisportsedge.app in incognito mode\n   - Check browser console for errors\n   - Confirm static assets load with 200 OK status\n   - Test Firebase and language toggle functionality\n\n## Why This Fix Works\n\nThis solution works because it addresses both root causes:\n1. Incorrect public URL causing 404s for static assets\n2. Missing .htaccess file causing CSP and routing issues\n\nBy setting the correct public URL and ensuring .htaccess is included in the deployment, we ensure that all assets load correctly and the proper headers are set.","partial":false},{"ts":1745420795451,"type":"ask","ask":"completion_result","text":""},{"ts":1745420799977,"type":"say","say":"user_feedback","text":"run the deployment script","images":[]},{"ts":1745420800022,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"request\":\"[attempt_completion] Result:\\n\\nThe user has provided feedback on the results.

This guide will walk you through the installation and setup process.\\n 5 | \\n 6 | ## Installation Steps\\n 7 | \\n 8 | ### 1. Open VS Code Extensions Panel\\n 9 | - Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window\\n10 | - Or use the keyboard shortcut:\\n11 |   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+X`\\n12 |   - macOS: `Cmd+Shift+X`\\n13 | \\n14 | ### 2. Search for SFTP\\n15 | - Type \\\"SFTP\\\" in the search box\\n16 | - Look for \\\"SFTP\\\" by Natizyskunk (not the older one by liximomo which is deprecated)\\n17 | \\n18 | ### 3. Install the Extension\\n19 | - Click the \\\"Install\\\" button next to the SFTP extension\\n20 | \\n21 | ![VS Code SFTP Extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Natizyskunk/vscode-sftp/master/assets/logo.png)\\n22 | \\n23 | ### 4. Reload VS Code\\n24 | - After installation, you may need to reload VS Code\\n25 | - Click the \\\"Reload\\\" button if prompted\\n26 | \\n27 | ## Configuration\\n28 | The `.vscode/sftp.json` file has already been created with your SFTP credentials:\\n29 | \\n30 | ```json\\n31 | {\\n32 |   \\\"host\\\": \\\"sftp.aisportsedge.app\\\",\\n33 |   \\\"port\\\": 22,\\n34 |   \\\"username\\\": \\\"deploy@aisportsedge.app\\\",\\n35 |   \\\"password\\\": \\\"hTQ3LQ]#P(b,\\\",\\n36 |   \\\"remotePath\\\": \\\"/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app/deploy\\\",\\n37 |   \\\"protocol\\\": \\\"sftp\\\",\\n38 |   \\\"uploadOnSave\\\": true\\n39 | }\\n40 | ```\\n41 | \\n42 | ## Using the Extension\\n43 | \\n44 | ### Uploading Files\\n45 | 1. Right-click on a file in the Explorer panel\\n46 | 2. Select \\\"SFTP: Upload\\\" from the context menu\\n47 | 3. The file will be uploaded to the remote path specified in your configuration\\n48 | \\n49 | ### Keyboard Shortcuts\\n50 | - Upload current file: `Ctrl+Alt+U` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+U` (macOS)\\n51 | - Upload selected files: Select multiple files, right-click, and choose \\\"SFTP: Upload\\\"\\n52 | \\n53 | ### Automatic Upload\\n54 | With `\\\"uploadOnSave\\\": true` in your configuration, files will automatically be uploaded whenever you save them.\\n55 | \\n56 | ## Troubleshooting\\n57 | \\n58 | ### Connection Issues\\n59 | - Verify your SFTP credentials are correct\\n60 | - Check if the server is accessible from your network\\n61 | - Ensure the remote path exists on the server\\n62 | \\n63 | ### Permission Issues\\n64 | - Check if your user has write permissions to the remote directory\\n65 | - Try changing the permissions of the remote directory if needed\\n66 | \\n67 | ### Extension Not Working\\n68 | - Check the Output panel in VS Code for SFTP logs\\n69 | - Select \\\"SFTP\\\" from the dropdown in the Output panel\\n70 | - Look for error messages that might indicate the issue\\n71 | \\n72 | ## Additional Resources\\n73 | - [VS Code SFTP Extension Documentation](https://github.com/Natizyskunk/vscode-sftp)\\n74 | - [VS Code Extensions Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)\\n</content>\\n</file>\\n\\n<environment_details>\\n# VSCode Visible Files\\nscripts/deploy-scp.sh\\n\\n# VSCode Open Tabs\\nvscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json,scripts/README.md,docs/sftp-upload-guide.md,commit-message-sftp-security.txt,scripts/push-sftp-security-fix.sh,scripts/test-secure-deploy.sh,commit-message-deployment-fixes.txt,scripts/push-deployment-fixes.sh,commit-message-changelog.txt,scripts/push-changelog.sh,fix-frontend-blockers.md,commit-message-final-frontend-fixes.txt,scripts/push-final-frontend-fixes.sh,final-frontend-fixes.md,commit-message-health-check.txt,scripts/push-health-check.sh,docs/deployment-health-check.md,CHANGELOG.md,commit-message-changelog-update.txt,scripts/push-changelog-update.sh\\n\\n# Actively Running Terminals\\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\\n\\n# Current Time\\n4/23/2025, 11:29:43 AM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\\n\\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\\n148,599 (74%)\\n\\n# Current Cost\\n$9.47\\n\\n# Current Mode\\n<slug>architect</slug>\\n<name>Architect</name>\\n<model>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</model>\\n<role>You are Roo, an experienced technical leader who is inquisitive and an excellent planner.

The user has just downloaded the Natizyskunk SFTP extension but is unsure about the configuration file location. I can see from the open tabs that there's a file at vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json, which is likely the current configuration file.\n\nLet me create a comprehensive plan to address these issues:\n\n# Plan to Fix SFTP Deployment Issues in VS Code\n\nBased on the information gathered, I've identified that you're using Natizyskunk's SFTP extension but the \"Upload Folder\" command is missing. Let me outline a comprehensive plan to fix these issues.\n\n## Current Situation Analysis\n\n1. **Extension Status**: You've recently downloaded Natizyskunk's SFTP extension\n2. **Configuration Location**: There's a configuration file at `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json`\n3. **Issue**: The \"Upload Folder\" command is missing from the context menu\n4. **Goal**: Enable reliable SFTP-based uploads to `/public_html/aisportsedge.app/`\n\n## Root Causes & Solutions\n\nThe issues are likely caused by:\n1. Configuration file in the wrong location\n2. Incorrect configuration format for the Natizyskunk extension\n3. Missing debug logging to identify specific issues\n4. VS Code might need to be restarted after configuration changes\n\n## Detailed Implementation Plan\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Identify Installed SFTP Extension] --> B[Verify Extension Configuration]\n    B --> C[Create Proper Config File]\n    C --> D[Enable Debug Logging]\n    D --> E[Restart VS Code]\n    E --> F[Test SFTP Commands]\n    F --> G[Verify Deployment]\n```\n\n### Phase 1: Identify & Verify Extension\n\n1. **Confirm Extension Details**\n   - Check the exact extension ID and version\n   - Verify it's properly installed and activated\n   - Review the extension's documentation for correct configuration format\n\n2. **Examine Current Configuration**\n   - Check if the configuration is in the correct location\n   - Verify the configuration format matches what the extension expects\n\n### Phase 2: Create Proper Configuration\n\n1. **Create `.vscode/sftp.json` in Project Root**\n   - This is the standard location where the extension looks for configuration\n   - Use the correct format for Natizyskunk's extension\n\n2. **Configure with Proper Settings**\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"AI Sports Edge\",\n     \"host\": \"aisportsedge.app\",\n     \"protocol\": \"sftp\",\n     \"port\": 22,\n     \"username\": \"deploy\",\n     \"password\": \"hTQ3LQ]#P(b,\",\n     \"remotePath\": \"/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app\",\n     \"uploadOnSave\": false,\n     \"ignore\": [\".vscode\", \".git\", \".DS_Store\", \"node_modules\"],\n     \"context\": \"./build\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Key Configuration Changes**\n   - Set `context` to `./build` to specify the local folder to upload\n   - Ensure `remotePath` points to the correct destination\n   - Set `uploadOnSave` to `false` to prevent automatic uploads\n\n### Phase 3: Enable Debug Logging\n\n1. **Add Debug Settings to VS Code**\n   - Add to VS Code settings.json:\n   ```json\n   \"sftp.debug\": true\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Output Panel**\n   - Open Output panel (View > Output)\n   - Select \"SFTP\" from the dropdown\n   - Monitor for error messages during operations\n\n### Phase 4: Test & Verify\n\n1. **Restart VS Code**\n   - Completely close and reopen VS Code\n   - This ensures all configuration changes are applied\n\n2. **Test SFTP Commands**\n   - Press Cmd+Shift+P to open command palette\n   - Search for \"SFTP: Upload\"\n   - Try both \"SFTP: Upload Active File\" and \"SFTP: Upload Folder\"\n\n3. **Verify Deployment**\n   - Check if files are properly uploaded to the server\n   - Verify the website works correctly after deployment\n\n## Fallback Options\n\nIf the above steps don't resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Alternative Command Usage**\n   - Use command palette (Cmd+Shift+P) instead of context menu\n   - Try \"SFTP: Upload Folder\" from the command palette\n\n2. **Alternative Extension**\n   - Consider installing a different SFTP extension if Natizyskunk's doesn't work\n   - Options include \"SFTP\" by liximomo (older but stable) or \"Remote - SSH\" by Microsoft\n\n3. **CLI-Based Deployment**\n   - Use the existing script-based deployment as a fallback\n   - Modify the scripts to use environment variables for credentials\n\n## Does this plan address your needs?

Configuration file in the wrong location\\n2. Incorrect configuration format for the Natizyskunk extension\\n3. Missing debug logging to identify specific issues\\n4. VS Code might need to be restarted after configuration changes\\n\\n## Detailed Implementation Plan\\n\\n```mermaid\\nflowchart TD\\n    A[Identify Installed SFTP Extension] --> B[Verify Extension Configuration]\\n    B --> C[Create Proper Config File]\\n    C --> D[Enable Debug Logging]\\n    D --> E[Restart VS Code]\\n    E --> F[Test SFTP Commands]\\n    F --> G[Verify Deployment]\\n```\\n\\n### Phase 1: Identify & Verify Extension\\n\\n1. **Confirm Extension Details**\\n   - Check the exact extension ID and version\\n   - Verify it's properly installed and activated\\n   - Review the extension's documentation for correct configuration format\\n\\n2. **Examine Current Configuration**\\n   - Check if the configuration is in the correct location\\n   - Verify the configuration format matches what the extension expects\\n\\n### Phase 2: Create Proper Configuration\\n\\n1. **Create `.vscode/sftp.json` in Project Root**\\n   - This is the standard location where the extension looks for configuration\\n   - Use the correct format for Natizyskunk's extension\\n\\n2. **Configure with Proper Settings**\\n   ```json\\n   {\\n     \\\"name\\\": \\\"AI Sports Edge\\\",\\n     \\\"host\\\": \\\"aisportsedge.app\\\",\\n     \\\"protocol\\\": \\\"sftp\\\",\\n     \\\"port\\\": 22,\\n     \\\"username\\\": \\\"deploy\\\",\\n     \\\"password\\\": \\\"hTQ3LQ]#P(b,\\\",\\n     \\\"remotePath\\\": \\\"/home/q15133yvmhnq/public_html/aisportsedge.app\\\",\\n     \\\"uploadOnSave\\\": false,\\n     \\\"ignore\\\": [\\\".vscode\\\", \\\".git\\\", \\\".DS_Store\\\", \\\"node_modules\\\"],\\n     \\\"context\\\": \\\"./build\\\"\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Key Configuration Changes**\\n   - Set `context` to `./build` to specify the local folder to upload\\n   - Ensure `remotePath` points to the correct destination\\n   - Set `uploadOnSave` to `false` to prevent automatic uploads\\n\\n### Phase 3: Enable Debug Logging\\n\\n1. **Add Debug Settings to VS Code**\\n   - Add to VS Code settings.json:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"sftp.debug\\\": true\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Check Output Panel**\\n   - Open Output panel (View > Output)\\n   - Select \\\"SFTP\\\" from the dropdown\\n   - Monitor for error messages during operations\\n\\n### Phase 4: Test & Verify\\n\\n1. **Restart VS Code**\\n   - Completely close and reopen VS Code\\n   - This ensures all configuration changes are applied\\n\\n2. **Test SFTP Commands**\\n   - Press Cmd+Shift+P to open command palette\\n   - Search for \\\"SFTP: Upload\\\"\\n   - Try both \\\"SFTP: Upload Active File\\\" and \\\"SFTP: Upload Folder\\\"\\n\\n3. **Verify Deployment**\\n   - Check if files are properly uploaded to the server\\n   - Verify the website works correctly after deployment\\n\\n## Fallback Options\\n\\nIf the above steps don't resolve the issue:\\n\\n1. **Alternative Command Usage**\\n   - Use command palette (Cmd+Shift+P) instead of context menu\\n   - Try \\\"SFTP: Upload Folder\\\" from the command palette\\n\\n2. **Alternative Extension**\\n   - Consider installing a different SFTP extension if Natizyskunk's doesn't work\\n   - Options include \\\"SFTP\\\" by liximomo (older but stable) or \\\"Remote - SSH\\\" by Microsoft\\n\\n3. **CLI-Based Deployment**\\n   - Use the existing script-based deployment as a fallback\\n   - Modify the scripts to use environment variables for credentials\"}","partial":false},{"ts":1745422351462,"type":"say","say":"checkpoint_saved","text":"fe5e0de4fea65b9cb4156a12181bcc2f43bc8b8b","checkpoint":{"isFirst":false,"from":"28f344acfe5a905e798f5b549a1a694916866540","to":"fe5e0de4fea65b9cb4156a12181bcc2f43bc8b8b"}},{"ts":1745422351477,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"request\":\"[write_to_file for 'docs/sftp-deployment-fix-plan.md'] Result:\\n\\nThe content was successfully saved to docs/sftp-deployment-fix-plan.md.\\n\\n<environment_details>\\n# VSCode Visible Files\\ndocs/sftp-deployment-fix-plan.md\\n\\n# VSCode Open Tabs\\nvscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json,scripts/README.md,docs/sftp-upload-guide.md,commit-message-sftp-security.txt,scripts/push-sftp-security-fix.sh,scripts/test-secure-deploy.sh,commit-message-deployment-fixes.txt,scripts/push-deployment-fixes.sh,commit-message-changelog.txt,scripts/push-changelog.sh,fix-frontend-blockers.md,commit-message-final-frontend-fixes.txt,scripts/push-final-frontend-fixes.sh,final-frontend-fixes.md,commit-message-health-check.txt,scripts/push-health-check.sh,docs/deployment-health-check.md,CHANGELOG.md,commit-message-changelog-update.txt,scripts/push-changelog-update.sh\\n\\n# Actively Running Terminals\\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\\n## Original command: `npx expo export --platform web`\\n\\n# Current Time\\n4/23/2025, 11:32:31 AM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)\\n\\n# Current Context Size (Tokens)\\n170,475 (85%)\\n\\n# Current Cost\\n$9.92\\n\\n# Current Mode\\n<slug>architect</slug>\\n<name>Architect</name>\\n<model>claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219</model>\\n<role>You are Roo, an experienced technical leader who is inquisitive and an excellent planner.
