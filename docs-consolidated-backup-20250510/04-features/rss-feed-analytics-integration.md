# RSS Feed Analytics Integration

This document outlines the analytics integration for the RSS feed system in AI Sports Edge. The analytics system tracks user engagement with RSS feeds and news content, providing valuable insights into which news sources and topics are most engaging to users.

## Overview

The RSS feed analytics integration consists of several components:

1. **Analytics Service**: A dedicated service for tracking RSS feed engagement
2. **Feed Tracking**: Tracking when feeds are viewed, loaded, and displayed
3. **Item Tracking**: Tracking when news items are clicked, hovered over, or interacted with
4. **Betting Tracking**: Tracking when betting buttons are clicked and conversions occur
5. **User Preferences Tracking**: Tracking user preferences for feeds and content

## Analytics Events

The following events are tracked by the RSS feed analytics system:

| Event | Description | Key Metrics |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `rss_feed_viewed` | When a feed is viewed | Source, item count, cached status |
| `rss_item_clicked` | When a news item is clicked | Item ID, source, position, betting opportunity |
| `rss_item_shared` | When a news item is shared | Item ID, platform |
| `rss_item_bookmarked` | When a news item is bookmarked | Item ID |
| `rss_bet_button_clicked` | When a bet button is clicked | Item ID, affiliate ID, odds |
| `rss_filter_applied` | When a filter is applied | Filter type, value, action |
| `rss_preferences_updated` | When preferences are updated | Preference type, new value |
| `rss_feed_impression` | When feeds are shown to the user | Sources, total items |
| `rss_feed_scroll` | When the feed is scrolled | Scroll depth, time spent |
| `rss_feed_hover` | When the user hovers over items | Item ID, hover duration |

## Implementation Details

### 1. RSS Analytics Service

The `rssAnalyticsService.js` provides functions for tracking various RSS feed events:

```javascript
import { 
  trackFeedViewed, 
  trackItemClicked,
  trackBetButtonClicked 
} from '../../services/rssAnalyticsService';

// Track when a feed is viewed
trackFeedViewed('NBA', 15, { cached: false });

// Track when an item is clicked
trackItemClicked(item, 'NBA', 3, { source: 'news_ticker' });

// Track when a bet button is clicked
trackBetButtonClicked(item, 'affiliate-123', { source: 'news_ticker' });
```

### 2. Feed Tracking in fetchRssFeeds.js

The RSS feed fetching system has been enhanced to track feed views and impressions:

```javascript
// Track feed viewed for analytics
trackFeedViewed(sportUpper, items.length, {
  cached: false,
  load_time_ms: loadTime,
  refresh_interval: preferences.rssFeeds.refreshIntervalMinutes
});

// Track feed impression for analytics
trackFeedImpression(Object.keys(results), 
  Object.values(results).reduce((total, items) => total + items.length, 0),
  { load_time_ms: totalTime }
);
```

### 3. User Interaction Tracking in NewsTicker.js

The news ticker component tracks user interactions with news items:

```javascript
// Handle item click for analytics
const handleItemClick = (item, position) => {
  trackItemClicked(item, item.sport, position, {
    source: 'news_ticker'
  });
};

// Handle bet button click for analytics
const handleBetButtonClick = (item, position) => {
  trackBetButtonClicked(item, bettingPrefs.affiliateId || 'default', {
    source: 'news_ticker',
    position
  });
};
```

### 4. Scroll and Hover Tracking

The news ticker also tracks scroll depth and hover behavior:

```javascript
// Track scroll depth for analytics
const maxScroll = tickerRef.current.scrollWidth - tickerRef.current.clientWidth;
const currentDepth = (tickerRef.current.scrollLeft / maxScroll) * 100;

// Only track when scroll depth increases by 25%
if (currentDepth - scrollDepthRef.current >= 25 || currentDepth === 0 && scrollDepthRef.current > 75) {
  // Calculate time spent since last tracking
  const now = Date.now();
  const timeSpent = scrollStartTimeRef.current ? (now - scrollStartTimeRef.current) / 1000 : 0;
  
  // Track scroll event
  trackFeedScroll(Math.round(currentDepth), timeSpent, {
    items_count: newsItems.length,
    scroll_speed: tickerSettings.scrollSpeed || 'medium'
  });
}
```

## Analytics Dashboard

The analytics data is available through API endpoints that can be used to build dashboards:

```javascript
// Get analytics data for a specific feed source
const nbaAnalytics = await getFeedAnalytics('NBA', 'week');

// Get popular news items based on analytics
const popularItems = await getPopularNewsItems('day', 10);

// Get user engagement metrics
const userMetrics = await getUserEngagementMetrics(userId);

// Get trending topics based on analytics
const trendingTopics = await getTrendingTopics('day', 10);

// Get conversion metrics for betting opportunities
const bettingMetrics = await getBettingConversionMetrics('week');
```

## Key Insights

The analytics system provides several key insights:

1. **Content Engagement**: Which news sources and topics are most engaging to users
2. **Betting Conversion**: Which news items lead to betting conversions
3. **User Behavior**: How users interact with the news ticker (scroll, hover, click)
4. **Content Preferences**: What types of content users prefer based on their interactions
5. **Performance Metrics**: How the RSS feed system is performing (load times, cache hits)

## Implementation Benefits

The analytics integration provides several benefits:

1. **Personalization**: Better understanding of user preferences for personalized content
2. **Optimization**: Insights for optimizing the news ticker and feed selection
3. **Monetization**: Tracking of betting conversions for revenue optimization
4. **Performance**: Monitoring of feed performance and caching effectiveness
5. **Content Strategy**: Data-driven decisions for content strategy

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the analytics system:

1. **Real-time Analytics**: Real-time dashboard for monitoring feed engagement
2. **A/B Testing**: Framework for testing different feed configurations
3. **Machine Learning**: Predictive models for content recommendation
4. **User Segmentation**: Segmentation of users based on feed preferences
5. **Notification Optimization**: Using analytics to optimize notification timing and content

## Technical Considerations

When implementing the analytics system, consider the following:

1. **Performance Impact**: Minimize the performance impact of analytics tracking
2. **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure compliance with privacy regulations
3. **Data Storage**: Implement efficient data storage for analytics data
4. **Data Processing**: Set up batch processing for analytics data
5. **Dashboard Access**: Control access to analytics dashboards

## Conclusion

The RSS feed analytics integration provides valuable insights into user engagement with news content, helping to optimize the user experience and monetization opportunities. By tracking various aspects of user interaction with the news ticker, we can better understand what content is most engaging and how to improve the overall experience.
