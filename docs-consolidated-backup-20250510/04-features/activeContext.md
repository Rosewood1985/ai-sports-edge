# Active Context: AI Pick of the Day Feature Implementation

## Current Implementation Focus

We are implementing the AI Pick of the Day feature for the AI Sports Edge application. This feature uses machine learning to predict game outcomes and selects the highest confidence prediction as the "Pick of the Day" to showcase to users.

## Components Implemented

1. **ML Component**:
   - Created prediction script (`ml/inference/predict_outcome.py`)
   - Created dummy model generation script (`ml/models/create_dummy_model.py`)
   - Created test script for the prediction pipeline (`ml/inference/test_prediction.py`)

2. **Firebase Cloud Functions**:
   - Implemented `predictTodayGames` function to predict outcomes for today's games
   - Implemented `markAIPickOfDay` function to select the top prediction as the Pick of the Day

3. **Frontend Components**:
   - Implemented `AIPickCard` component to display a prediction
   - Implemented `AIPickOfDayScreen` to display the Pick of the Day and other top picks
   - Implemented `LeaderboardScreen` to display a leaderboard of predictions
   - Implemented `aiPickSelector` service to fetch predictions from Firestore
   - Created navigation structure for the AI Picks section

## Current Status

- All components have been implemented and are ready for testing
- Documentation has been created for the ML component and Firebase Functions
- Memory bank entry has been created to document the implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:
   - Test the ML prediction pipeline
   - Test the Firebase Cloud Functions
   - Test the frontend components

2. **Integration**:
   - Integrate the AI Pick of the Day feature with the rest of the application
   - Ensure proper navigation between screens

3. **Optimization**:
   - Optimize Firestore queries to reduce costs
   - Implement caching to improve performance

4. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Implement more sophisticated ML models
   - Add support for more sports and leagues
   - Implement real-time updates based on pre-game information
