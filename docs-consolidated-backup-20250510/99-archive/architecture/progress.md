# Implementation Progress

## Firebase Authentication Fix

- [x] Created `debug-app-detailed.js` script to analyze the entire app architecture
- [x] Created `debug-service-init.js` script to debug Firebase initialization
- [x] Created `debug-services.js` script to check service dependencies and usage
- [x] Updated all deployment scripts to use `NODE_ENV=production npm run build:prod`
- [x] Updated Firebase configuration in `dist/login.html` to include `measurementId`
- [x] Created `deploy-firebase-fix.sh` script to deploy the Firebase fix

## Spanish Localization Implementation

- [x] Created `deploy-spanish-localization.sh` script to implement Spanish localization
- [x] Created language files and loader (`i18n/en.ts`, `i18n/es.ts`, `i18n/i18n.ts`)
- [x] Created language toggle component (`components/LanguageToggle.tsx`)
- [x] Created language detector and default preferences (`utils/languageDetector.ts`, `utils/defaultPreferences.ts`)
- [x] Created Firebase function for tracking soccer interaction (`functions/updateLanguageBasedOnBehavior.ts`)
- [x] Created odds formatter (`utils/oddsFormatter.ts`)
- [x] Created odds toggle component (`components/OddsToggle.tsx`)
- [x] Created Spanish-themed team cards (`components/SpanishTeamCard.tsx`)
- [x] Created sample Spanish teams data (`data/teams.ts`)

## Web App Architecture Cleanup

- [x] Created debugging scripts to identify issues
- [x] Created documentation for the Firebase API key issue
- [x] Created a comprehensive deployment plan

## Performance Optimization

- [x] Implement Firebase caching with `utils/firebaseCacheConfig.ts`
- [x] Optimize bundle size with `webpack.prod.optimized.js`
- [x] Implement service worker for caching with `public/service-worker.js`
- [x] Created `deploy-performance-optimization.sh` script to deploy performance optimizations

## Deployment

- [x] Created `deploy-combined.sh` script to run all deployment steps
- [x] Made all deployment scripts executable

## Documentation

- [x] Created `memory-bank/firebase-auth-debugging-summary.md`
- [x] Created `memory-bank/comprehensive-deployment-plan.md`
- [x] Created `spanish-localization-summary.md` for Spanish localization
- [x] Created `performance-optimization-summary.md` for performance optimization

## Next Steps

1. Run the combined deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-combined.sh
   ```

2. Run the performance optimization script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-performance-optimization.sh
   ```

3. Verify that all functionality works correctly:
   - Signup and login
   - Spanish localization
   - Language toggle
   - Odds format switching
   - Spanish-themed team cards
   - Offline functionality with service worker
   - Firebase caching

4. Monitor application performance:
   - Check Firebase usage metrics
   - Analyze bundle size with the bundle analyzer report
   - Test offline functionality
