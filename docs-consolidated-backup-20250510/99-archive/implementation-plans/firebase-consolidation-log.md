# Firebase Consolidation Status Log

## 2025-05-09

### Completed

- Created consolidated `src/services/firebaseService.ts` with lazy initialization
- Fixed TypeScript errors in the implementation
- Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/firebase-consolidation.md`
- Created migration script to identify Firebase usage
- Generated report showing 227 files to migrate
- Created migration tools:
  - `scripts/migrate-to-firebase-service.js` - Analyzes the codebase for Firebase usage
  - `scripts/migrate-firebase-file.js` - Automatically migrates files to use the consolidated service
  - `scripts/track-firebase-migration.js` - Tracks migration progress
- Created task list in `tasks/firebase-consolidation-tasks.md`
- Created migration guide in `docs/firebase-migration-guide.md`
- Added Firebase consolidation plan to memory bank

### Next Steps

1. Begin migrating high-priority files:
   - `src/config/firebase.js`
   - `src/config/firebase.ts`
   - `src/firebase/auth.js`
   - `src/firebase/config.js`
   - `src/firebase/firestore.js`
   - `src/firebase/index.js`
   - `src/firebase-auth.js`

2. Test each migration thoroughly before moving to the next file

3. Update tests to use the consolidated service

4. Remove duplicate Firebase initialization code

### Performance Impact

The consolidated Firebase service will improve performance by:
- Lazy initialization of Firebase services
- Reduced code duplication
- More efficient Firebase operations
- Better caching of Firebase instances

### Code Quality Impact

The consolidated Firebase service will improve code quality by:
- Providing a single source of truth for Firebase configuration
- Ensuring type safety for all Firebase operations
- Simplifying Firebase usage across the codebase
- Making testing and mocking easier

### Notes

- The migration should be done incrementally, not all at once
- Each migration should be tested thoroughly before moving to the next file
- The migration script can be re-run to track progress
