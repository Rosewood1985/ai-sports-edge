# Onboarding Security and Accessibility Improvements

This document outlines the security and accessibility improvements made to the onboarding experience in both the web and iOS apps.

## Security Improvements

### Web App

#### 1. Storage Security

- **Unique Key Prefix**: Added a unique prefix to localStorage keys to prevent conflicts with other applications.
- **Backup Storage**: Implemented sessionStorage as a backup for localStorage to improve reliability.
- **Storage Verification**: Added verification steps to ensure data is correctly stored and retrieved.
- **XSS Protection**: Added checks for potentially malicious values in stored data.

#### 2. Input Validation

- **Parameter Validation**: Added strict validation for all function parameters to prevent injection attacks.
- **Numeric Bounds Checking**: Implemented bounds checking for numeric inputs to prevent overflow attacks.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling to prevent information leakage.

#### 3. Data Sanitization

- **XSS Prevention**: Added sanitization for all user-generated content and analytics data.
- **Error Message Sanitization**: Sanitized error messages to prevent potential XSS attacks.
- **Content Security**: Implemented proper content security measures for user-generated content.

#### 4. Modal Improvements

- **Replaced window.confirm**: Replaced native window.confirm with a custom modal component for better security and accessibility.
- **Secure Navigation**: Improved navigation security by using controlled navigation flows.

### iOS App

#### 1. Error Handling

- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks to all asynchronous operations.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Implemented fallback mechanisms for when operations fail.
- **Error Logging**: Enhanced error logging with sanitized error messages.

#### 2. Input Validation

- **Parameter Validation**: Added validation for all function parameters.
- **Bounds Checking**: Implemented bounds checking for numeric inputs.

## Accessibility Improvements

### Web App

#### 1. Modal Accessibility

- **ARIA Attributes**: Added proper ARIA attributes to modal components.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Improved keyboard navigation for modals.
- **Focus Management**: Implemented proper focus management for modal dialogs.

#### 2. Screen Reader Support

- **Descriptive Labels**: Added descriptive labels for all interactive elements.
- **Semantic HTML**: Used semantic HTML elements for better screen reader support.
- **ARIA Live Regions**: Implemented ARIA live regions for dynamic content.

### iOS App

#### 1. Component Accessibility

- **Accessibility Roles**: Added proper accessibility roles to all components.
- **Accessibility Labels**: Added descriptive accessibility labels for all interactive elements.
- **Accessibility Hints**: Added accessibility hints for complex interactions.

#### 2. Image Accessibility

- **Alt Text**: Added alt text for all images.
- **Decorative Images**: Marked decorative images as such for screen readers.

## Performance Improvements

### Web App

- **Optimized Storage**: Improved storage operations to reduce overhead.
- **Error Recovery**: Added recovery mechanisms for storage failures.
- **Analytics Optimization**: Separated analytics from core functionality to prevent blocking.

### iOS App

- **FlatList Optimization**: Added error handling and fallback mechanisms for FlatList operations.
- **Animation Performance**: Improved animation performance with proper error handling.

## Translation Improvements

- **Error Messages**: Added translations for all error messages.
- **Accessibility Labels**: Added translations for all accessibility labels.
- **Modal Content**: Added translations for all modal content.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Storage Testing**: Test the application in private browsing mode to verify graceful degradation.
2. **Accessibility Testing**: Use screen readers to verify accessibility improvements.
3. **Error Handling Testing**: Simulate errors to verify error handling mechanisms.
4. **Security Testing**: Perform XSS testing to verify sanitization measures.
5. **Performance Testing**: Test on low-end devices to verify performance improvements.
