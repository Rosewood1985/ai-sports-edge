# AI Sports Edge Performance Optimization Summary

## Optimization Timestamp
20250417_212851

## Steps Completed
1. ✓ Implemented Firebase caching
   - Created utils/firebaseCacheConfig.ts
   - Added functions for cache initialization, clearing, and document retrieval

2. ✓ Optimized bundle size
   - Created webpack.prod.optimized.js
   - Added code splitting and tree shaking
   - Added compression plugin
   - Added bundle analyzer

3. ✓ Implemented service worker for caching
   - Created public/service-worker.js
   - Created public/register-service-worker.js
   - Updated index.html to include service worker registration

## Usage

### Firebase Caching
Initialize Firebase caching in your app entry point:
```javascript
import { initializeFirestoreCache } from './utils/firebaseCacheConfig';

// Initialize Firestore cache
initializeFirestoreCache();
```

Retrieve documents with cache support:
```javascript
import { getDocumentFromCache } from './utils/firebaseCacheConfig';

// Get document with cache support
const { data, fromCache } = await getDocumentFromCache('users', 'user123');
```

### Optimized Bundle
Build the application with optimized bundle:
```bash
npm run build:optimized
```

### Service Worker
The service worker will automatically register when the application loads.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor application performance
2. Analyze bundle size with the bundle analyzer report
3. Test offline functionality with the service worker
4. Implement additional performance optimizations as needed
