# Referral Program & Leaderboard System

## Overview

This repository contains the complete documentation for implementing a referral program and gamified leaderboard system for AI Sports Edge. The implementation is designed to drive user acquisition, improve retention, and enhance engagement through gamification elements.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following categories:

1. **Executive and Planning Documents**: High-level overviews and planning documents
2. **Technical Specifications**: Detailed technical specifications for implementation
3. **Design Documents**: UI/UX design specifications
4. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Testing strategies and plans
5. **Analytics and Measurement**: Analytics implementation and success metrics

For a complete list of documents with descriptions, see the [Documentation Index](./referral-program-documentation-index.md).

## Key Features

### Referral Program

- **Unique Referral Codes**: Each subscribed user receives a shareable referral code
- **Dual-Sided Rewards**: Both referrer and referred user receive benefits
- **Tiered Milestone System**: Increasing rewards for reaching referral milestones
- **Multiple Sharing Options**: Easy sharing via SMS, email, and social media

### Leaderboard System

- **Real-Time Rankings**: Live leaderboard showing top referrers
- **Tiered Badges**: Visual recognition of referral achievements
- **Time-Based Leaderboards**: Weekly, monthly, and all-time rankings
- **Privacy Controls**: Users can choose how they appear on leaderboards

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a phased approach over 6 weeks:

1. **Foundation** (Week 1): Core infrastructure and basic functionality
2. **Reward System** (Week 2): Reward distribution and milestone tracking
3. **Leaderboard & UI** (Week 3): Leaderboard system and user interface
4. **Gamification & Polish** (Week 4): Badges, animations, and social features
5. **Testing & Optimization** (Week 5): Testing and performance optimization
6. **Launch & Monitoring** (Week 6): Deployment and performance monitoring

For a detailed implementation roadmap, see the [Implementation Roadmap](./referral-program-implementation-roadmap.md).

## Getting Started

To get started with the implementation, follow these steps:

1. Review the [Executive Summary](./referral-program-executive-summary.md) to understand the strategic value and expected outcomes.
2. Review the [Implementation Plan](./referral-program-implementation-plan.md) to understand the approach and timeline.
3. Assemble the implementation team with the required roles and skills.
4. Set up the development environment with the required tools and infrastructure.
5. Begin implementation with Phase 1: Foundation.

## Implementation Team

The implementation requires the following team members:

- 1 Project Manager
- 2 Backend Developers (Firebase)
- 2 Frontend Developers (React Native)
- 1 UI/UX Designer
- 1 QA Engineer
- 1 Data Engineer
- 1 Security Engineer

## Technical Requirements

The implementation leverages the existing technology stack:
