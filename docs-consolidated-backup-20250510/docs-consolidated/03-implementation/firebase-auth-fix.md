# Firebase Authentication Fix

## Fix Timestamp
2025-04-18T01:45:11.670Z

## Issues Fixed
1. Changed ES module imports to script tags - ES modules can't be used directly in browser without proper bundling
2. Updated Firebase SDK to version 8.x which has a simpler API for browser usage
3. Fixed Firebase initialization to use global firebase object
4. Updated auth methods to use the correct syntax for Firebase 8.x

## Files Fixed
- build/bundle.js - Updated to use script tags instead of ES modules
- build/index.html - Updated to include Firebase SDK script tags
- deploy/bundle.js - Updated for deployment
- deploy/index.html - Updated for deployment

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the fixed files to Firebase Hosting
2. Test the authentication flow end-to-end
3. Add user profile management
4. Implement email verification

## Technical Details
The main issue was trying to use ES module imports directly in the browser. Firebase 9+ uses ES modules by default, but they need to be properly bundled for browser usage. We switched to Firebase 8.x which has a simpler API for direct browser usage with script tags.
