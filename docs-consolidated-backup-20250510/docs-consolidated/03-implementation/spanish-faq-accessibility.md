# Spanish FAQ Accessibility Guide

This document provides guidelines and information about the accessibility features implemented for the Spanish version of the FAQ section in the AI Sports Edge app.

## Overview

The Spanish FAQ section has been enhanced with comprehensive accessibility features to ensure that Spanish-speaking users with disabilities can fully access and interact with the content. These enhancements include proper screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and semantic markup.

## Implemented Accessibility Features

### 1. Screen Reader Support

All text content in the Spanish FAQ section is properly labeled for screen readers:

- FAQ questions have appropriate `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint` properties
- FAQ answers are announced when expanded
- Form elements have descriptive labels and hints
- Error messages are properly announced

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

The FAQ section supports keyboard navigation:

- FAQ questions can be focused and activated with keyboard
- Form elements can be navigated and activated with keyboard
- Focus order follows a logical sequence

### 3. Semantic Markup

Elements use proper semantic roles:

- FAQ questions use `accessibilityRole="button"`
- FAQ answers use `accessibilityRole="text"`
- Form elements use appropriate roles

### 4. State Information

Interactive elements communicate their state:

- Expanded/collapsed state of FAQ items is conveyed via `accessibilityState`
- Disabled state of form elements is properly communicated

## Translation Considerations

When translating accessibility-related content, special attention was paid to:

1. **Context**: Ensuring that screen reader announcements make sense in context
2. **Brevity**: Keeping labels concise while still being descriptive
3. **Clarity**: Using clear language that avoids idioms or complex constructions
4. **Consistency**: Maintaining consistent terminology throughout the app

## Testing

Accessibility features have been tested using:

1. **Automated Tests**: Unit tests that verify the presence of accessibility attributes
2. **Screen Reader Testing**: Manual testing with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
3. **Keyboard Navigation Testing**: Ensuring all interactive elements can be accessed

## Spanish-Specific Considerations

Some special considerations for Spanish accessibility:

1. **Pronunciation**: Ensuring that screen readers correctly pronounce Spanish words, including accented characters
2. **Text Length**: Spanish text is often longer than English, requiring adjustments to layout
3. **Reading Direction**: Spanish is left-to-right, but some screen readers may need configuration

## Implementation Details

### FAQ Questions

```tsx
<TouchableOpacity 
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityRole="button"
  accessibilityLabel={question}
  accessibilityHint={t('faq.accessibility.questionHint')}
  accessibilityState={{ expanded: isExpanded }}
>
  <Text>{question}</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### FAQ Answers

```tsx
<View 
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityRole="text"
  accessibilityLabel={`${t('faq.accessibility.answer')}: ${answer}`}
>
  <Text>{answer}</Text>
</View>
```

### Form Elements

```tsx
<TextInput
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityLabel={t('faq.accessibility.questionInput')}
  accessibilityHint={t('faq.accessibility.questionInputHint')}
/>

<TouchableOpacity
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityRole="button"
  accessibilityLabel={t('faq.accessibility.submitButton')}
  accessibilityHint={t('faq.accessibility.submitButtonHint')}
  accessibilityState={{ disabled: isDisabled }}
>
  <Text>{t('faq.form.submit')}</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. **Voice Input**: Support for Spanish voice commands
2. **Regional Variations**: Support for different Spanish dialects
3. **Accessibility Preferences**: Allow users to customize accessibility settings
4. **Improved Announcements**: More contextual screen reader announcements
