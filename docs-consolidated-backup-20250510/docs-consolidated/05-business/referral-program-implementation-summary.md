## Overview

The referral program and leaderboard system is designed to drive user acquisition and retention by incentivizing users to refer friends to the platform. The system includes:

- Referral code generation and sharing
- Milestone-based rewards
- Leaderboard with privacy controls
- Notification system for referral events
- A/B testing framework for optimizing reward structures

## Implementation Phases

The implementation was completed in four phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Core Infrastructure)

- Backend infrastructure for referral tracking
- Data models for referrals, milestones, and rewards
- Basic UI components for displaying referral information
- Service layer for interacting with backend

### Phase 2: Reward System (Reward Distribution)

- Backend implementation for processing rewards
- Notification system for referral events
- UI components for displaying rewards and milestones
- Screens for managing referrals and rewards

### Phase 3: Leaderboard & UI (Leaderboard System)

- Leaderboard components with time period filters
- Privacy controls for leaderboard participation
- Podium display for top performers
- Position change indicators

### Phase 4: Gamification & Polish (Final Touches)

- Animations for milestone achievements
- Enhanced social sharing options
- A/B testing framework for reward optimization
- Performance and UX improvements

## Component Structure

### UI Components

- **ReferralProgramCard**: Displays referral code and basic stats
- **ReferralMilestoneProgress**: Shows progress toward referral milestones
- **ReferralBadge**: Displays tiered badges for referral achievements
- **ReferralLeaderboard**: Displays leaderboard with podium and rankings
- **ReferralNotification**: Shows celebratory notifications for milestones
- **ReferralShareOptions**: Provides options for sharing referral code
- **LeaderboardPositionChange**: Shows animated position changes
- **MilestoneAchievementAnimation**: Displays animations for milestone achievements
- **ReferralPrivacySettings**: Controls privacy settings for leaderboard

### Screens

- **ReferralRewardsScreen**: Displays available rewards and progress
- **ReferralLeaderboardScreen**: Shows leaderboard with time period filters
- **ReferralNotificationsScreen**: Displays notifications for referral events

## Backend Services

### Firebase Functions

- **referralProgram.js**: Core functionality for referral tracking
- **referralRewards.js**: Processing rewards for referrals
- **leaderboardUpdates.js**: Scheduled updates for leaderboard data

### Service Layer

- **rewardsService.ts**: Interface for interacting with rewards backend
- **referralNotificationService.ts**: Manages notification data

## A/B Testing Framework

The A/B testing framework (`referralABTesting.ts`) allows for testing different reward structures to optimize conversion rates. Four variants are implemented:

1. **Control**: Default reward structure
2. **Subscription-focused**: More subscription extensions
3. **Cash-focused**: More cash rewards
4. **Early rewards**: More rewards at lower milestones

The framework tracks variant assignment, conversions, and milestone claims to determine the most effective reward structure.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. **Enhanced Analytics**: More detailed analytics for referral performance
2. **Multi-tier Referrals**: Rewards for second-level referrals
3. **Seasonal Campaigns**: Time-limited referral campaigns with special rewards
4. **Referral Challenges**: Group challenges for referrals
5. **Integration with Social Platforms**: Direct sharing to social platforms
