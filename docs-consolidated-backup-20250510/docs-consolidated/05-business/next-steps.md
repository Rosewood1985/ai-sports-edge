# AI Sports Edge: Next Steps

## Overview

This document outlines the next steps for the AI Sports Edge project, focusing on transitioning from the planning phase to implementation. It provides a roadmap for the development team to follow in order to complete the pre-deployment tasks and prepare the app for live release.

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Code Mode Handoff

The first step is to hand off the implementation plans to the Code mode for execution:

1. **Review Documentation**: The Code team should review all documentation created during the planning phase:
   - `docs/privacy-policy.md`
   - `docs/terms-of-service.md`
   - `docs/liability-waiver.md`
   - `docs/liability-waiver-integration.md`
   - `docs/liability-waiver-implementation-plan.md`
   - `docs/responsible-gambling-screens.md`
   - `docs/age-verification-screen.md`
   - `docs/onboarding-verification-flow.md`
   - `docs/live-deployment-preparation-summary.md`
   - `docs/live-deployment-checklist.md`
2. **Prioritize Implementation Tasks**: Based on the documentation, prioritize the implementation tasks:
   - Legal components in the following order:
     1. Age Verification Screen
     2. Self-Exclusion Check Screen
     3. Responsible Gambling Screen
     4. Liability Waiver Screen
     5. Legal Links Component
     6. Legal Screen
   - Service layer integration (user service, Firebase)
   - Navigation updates
   - Translation updates
   - Translation updates

3. **Create Implementation Tickets**: Break down the implementation plan into specific tickets or tasks that can be assigned to developers.

### 2. Legal Review

Arrange for legal review of all legal documents:

1. **Engage Legal Counsel**: Provide the privacy policy, terms of service, and liability waiver to legal counsel for review.
2. **Jurisdiction Check**: Verify compliance with regulations in all target jurisdictions.
3. **Document Revisions**: Make any necessary revisions based on legal feedback.
4. **Final Approval**: Obtain final legal approval before implementation.

### 3. Technical Preparation

Prepare the technical infrastructure for implementation:

1. **Firebase Setup**: Ensure Firebase is configured to store user acceptance of legal documents.
2. **Analytics Configuration**: Set up analytics to track legal document interactions.
3. **Testing Environment**: Prepare the testing environment for the new components.
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Update the CI/CD pipeline to include tests for the new components.

## Medium-Term Tasks

### 4. Implementation Phase

Execute the implementation plan:

1. **Component Development**: Implement all UI components as specified in the documentation.
2. **Service Layer Integration**: Implement the service layer functions for legal document acceptance.
3. **Navigation Integration**: Update the navigation to include the new screens.
4. **Translation Integration**: Add all required translation keys.

### 5. Testing Phase

Conduct comprehensive testing:

1. **Unit Testing**: Test all components in isolation.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the integration of components with the rest of the app.
3. **User Testing**: Conduct user testing to ensure the legal documents are clear and understandable.
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Verify all components are accessible.
5. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test on both iOS and Android.

### 6. Refinement Phase

Refine the implementation based on testing feedback:

1. **Bug Fixes**: Address any issues identified during testing.
2. **UX Improvements**: Make any necessary improvements to the user experience.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the performance of the new components.
4. **Final Review**: Conduct a final review of all implemented features.

## Long-Term Tasks

### 7. App Store Preparation

Prepare for app store submission:

1. **Privacy Labels**: Complete privacy "nutrition labels" for the App Store.
2. **App Review Guidelines**: Verify compliance with app store review guidelines.
3. **Screenshots and Descriptions**: Prepare app store assets.
4. **Submission Plan**: Create a plan for app store submission.

### 8. Launch Planning

Plan for the app launch:

1. **Marketing Strategy**: Develop a marketing strategy for the app launch.
2. **Support Plan**: Create a plan for user support after launch.
3. **Monitoring Plan**: Set up monitoring for the app after launch.
4. **Update Roadmap**: Develop a roadmap for post-launch updates.

## Transition to Code Mode

To facilitate a smooth transition to Code mode for implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Use the `switch_mode` Tool**: Request to switch to Code mode using the following command:

```
<switch_mode>
<mode_slug>code</mode_slug>
<reason>Ready to implement the liability waiver component and other legal requirements based on the detailed implementation plan.</reason>
</switch_mode>
```

2. **Provide Context**: When switching to Code mode, provide a brief summary of the work completed in Architect mode and the next steps for implementation.

3. **Reference Documentation**: Direct the Code mode to the relevant documentation files for implementation details.

## Conclusion

By following this roadmap, the AI Sports Edge team can efficiently transition from the planning phase to implementation and prepare the app for live deployment. The comprehensive documentation created during the planning phase provides a solid foundation for the implementation work, ensuring that all legal requirements are met while maintaining a good user experience.

The most critical next step is to hand off the implementation plans to the Code mode and begin the implementation of the liability waiver component, as this is a key legal requirement for the app. Once this is complete, the team can proceed with the other pre-deployment tasks outlined in the documentation.
