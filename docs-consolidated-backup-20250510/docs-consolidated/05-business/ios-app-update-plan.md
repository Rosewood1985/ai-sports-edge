# iOS Mobile App Update Plan for AI Sports Edge

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for updating the AI Sports Edge iOS mobile app to match the web app functionality, with a focus on Firebase compatibility and feature parity.

## Current State Analysis

### Web Application
- Uses Firebase for authentication, data storage, and real-time updates
- Recently improved Firebase security by moving hardcoded credentials to environment variables
- Fixed GoDaddy hosting compatibility issues
- Uses a modern webpack configuration for building

### iOS Application
- Native iOS app (Swift)
- Uses Firebase for backend services
- Firebase configuration is stored in `firebase-config/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- Currently may not have the same feature set as the web app

### Firebase Configuration
- Firebase credentials are properly configured in environment variables for the web app
- iOS app uses the standard Firebase configuration approach with `GoogleService-Info.plist`

## Detailed Plan for iOS App Update
