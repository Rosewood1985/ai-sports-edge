### 2025-04-23 - fix: resolve frontend blocking issues for aisportsedge.app
--

### 2025-04-23 - fix: reset and clean production web deployment

while ensuring all new files have correct MIME types and security headers.

The deployment process now includes proper error handling, verification
steps, and optional Lighthouse auditing to ensure everything works correctly.


### 2025-04-23 - fix: Update SFTP configuration for reliable deployment

- Added "context": "./build" to specify the local folder to upload
- Set "uploadOnSave": false to prevent automatic uploads
- Enabled SFTP debug logging in VS Code settings
- Synchronized configuration between project root and vscode-sftp-deploy

This fixes the missing "Upload Folder" command issue by properly configuring the Natizyskunk SFTP extension with the correct context path and debug settings.


### 2025-04-23 - fix: Correct SFTP context path to fix config loading
--
- Removed duplicate sftp.json from .vscode/ directory
- Created symbolic link from .vscode/sftp.json to vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json
- Ensured configuration uses "context": "build" instead of "./build"
- Added documentation in sftp-config-fix-summary.md

This fix resolves the issue where the SFTP extension was failing with "Config Not Found" errors by ensuring there's only one configuration file in the correct location with the proper path format.

--

- Created deploy-and-fix-build-location.sh script that:
  - Uploads build folder via SFTP
  - Creates fix-build-location.sh script inside build folder
  - Executes the fix script on the server after upload
  - Moves all build files to the root directory on the server
  - Cleans up empty build folder on server
  - Logs deployment status

This script solves the issue where files uploaded to the build/ directory on the server need to be moved to the root directory for the site to function properly.


### 2025-04-23 - feat: Add deployment status check scripts

- Created check-deployment-status.sh for basic site accessibility checks
- Created detailed-deployment-check.sh for comprehensive diagnostics:
  - Server connectivity checks
  - SSH connection verification
  - File existence verification on server
  - Automatic fix script execution if needed
  - DNS resolution checks
--

These scripts help diagnose deployment issues by providing detailed information about the server and website status, making it easier to troubleshoot deployment problems.


### 2025-04-23 - fix: Add script to fix permissions and build location on server

- Created fix-permissions-and-build.sh script that:
--

### 2025-04-23 - feat: Add automated deployment and verification script

- Created automated-deploy-and-verify.sh script that:
  - Extracts SFTP credentials from configuration
  - Uploads build folder via SFTP using lftp
  - SSHs into server and runs fix script
  - Verifies .htaccess exists
  - Checks HTTP status of website
  - Verifies assets are loading
  - Runs detailed deployment check

This script automates the entire deployment process, from uploading the build folder to verifying the deployment, eliminating the need for manual steps and reducing the chance of deployment errors.


### 2025-04-23 - feat: Add deployment configuration validator

- Created validate-deployment-config.sh script that:
  - Ensures we're in the correct root workspace
  - Verifies .vscode/sftp.json is a symlink to vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json
  - Checks if build directory exists
  - Validates .htaccess exists in build directory (creates if missing)
  - Updates SFTP configuration with correct credentials

- Updated automated-deploy-and-verify.sh to run the validator before deployment

This ensures all deployment prerequisites are met before attempting to deploy, preventing common deployment issues and ensuring a consistent deployment process.


### 2025-04-23 - feat: Add manual fallback deployment script

- Created manual-fallback-deploy.sh script that:
  - Validates deployment configuration
  - Creates a zip file of the build directory
  - Provides step-by-step instructions for manual deployment via GoDaddy control panel
  - Includes commands for setting proper file permissions

This script provides a reliable fallback method for deployment when automated SFTP deployment fails, ensuring the site can still be deployed even when there are connectivity or permission issues with the automated process.


### 2025-04-23 - ci: Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment

- Created deploy-to-godaddy.yml workflow that:
  - Triggers on push to main branch
  - Uploads build folder via SFTP to GoDaddy server
  - Runs server-side fix script to set permissions and move files
  - Performs a basic health check on the deployed site

This workflow automates the entire deployment process, eliminating manual steps and ensuring consistent deployments. It securely stores credentials as GitHub secrets and provides immediate feedback on deployment status.


### 2025-04-23 - docs: Add comprehensive deployment guide

- Created deployment-guide.md that documents:
  - Three deployment options (GitHub Actions, Automated Script, Manual Fallback)
  - Step-by-step instructions for each deployment method
  - Troubleshooting steps for common deployment issues
  - Configuration details for deployment settings

This guide provides a single source of truth for all deployment-related information, making it easier for team members to understand and execute deployments consistently.
