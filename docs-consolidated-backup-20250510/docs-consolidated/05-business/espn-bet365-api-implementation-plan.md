# ESPN Hidden API and Bet365 API Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the AI Sports Edge ML model with comprehensive data from ESPN Hidden API and Bet365 API. The integration will improve prediction accuracy and provide more valuable insights for users.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Update the Data Fetcher

**Objective**: Enhance `api/ml-sports-edge/data/fetch-enhanced.js` to include more comprehensive ESPN API endpoints beyond the basic scoreboard we're currently using.

**Implementation Details**:
- Add support for the following ESPN API endpoints:
  - `/sports/{sport}/scoreboard` - Enhanced scoreboard with detailed game information
  - `/sports/{sport}/teams/{teamId}` - Detailed team information
  - `/sports/{sport}/athletes/{athleteId}` - Player statistics and information
  - `/sports/{sport}/news` - Latest news and analysis
  - `/sports/{sport}/standings` - Current standings and rankings
  - `/sports/{sport}/statistics` - Team and player statistics

**Technical Approach**:
- Implement a modular endpoint system that allows for easy addition of new endpoints
- Add caching mechanism to reduce API calls
- Implement rate limiting to avoid API restrictions
- Add error handling and retry logic for robustness

**Expected Outcome**:
- Richer dataset with more comprehensive game, team, and player information
- Improved data quality and reliability
- Reduced API calls through efficient caching

### 2. Expand Feature Engineering

**Objective**: Modify `api/ml-sports-edge/models/features.js` to extract additional features from the richer ESPN data.

**Implementation Details**:
- Add new feature extraction methods for:
  - Team performance metrics (win streaks, home/away performance)
  - Player performance metrics (key player statistics, injuries)
  - Historical matchup data (head-to-head records)
  - Situational factors (rest days, travel distance)
  - Momentum indicators (recent form, scoring trends)

**Technical Approach**:
- Implement a feature registry system to manage and document features
- Create feature groups for different types of analysis
- Add feature importance tracking to identify most valuable predictors
- Implement feature normalization and scaling

**Expected Outcome**:
- More comprehensive feature set for model training
- Improved feature quality and relevance
- Better documentation and management of features

### 3. Create Sport-Specific Normalizers

**Objective**: For each sport, create specialized data normalizers that can handle the unique statistics provided by ESPN.

**Implementation Details**:
- Create normalizers for the following sports:
  - Basketball (NBA, NCAA)
  - Football (NFL, NCAA)
  - Baseball (MLB)
  - Hockey (NHL)
  - Soccer (MLS, Premier League, La Liga, etc.)
  - Tennis
  - Golf
  - MMA/UFC

**Technical Approach**:
- Implement a base normalizer class with common functionality
- Create sport-specific normalizer classes that inherit from the base class
- Add methods for handling unique statistics for each sport
- Implement data validation and cleaning

**Expected Outcome**:
- Consistent data format across different sports
- Proper handling of sport-specific statistics
- Improved data quality and reliability

### 4. Historical Data Collection

**Objective**: Implement a process to collect and store historical data from ESPN for better model training.

**Implementation Details**:
- Create a historical data collector that can:
  - Fetch historical game data for multiple seasons
  - Store data in a structured format (CSV, JSON, or database)
  - Update historical data periodically
  - Handle incremental updates to avoid redundant fetching

**Technical Approach**:
- Implement a scheduler for periodic data collection
- Create a database schema for efficient storage and retrieval
- Add data versioning to track changes
- Implement data integrity checks

**Expected Outcome**:
- Comprehensive historical dataset for model training
- Improved model accuracy through better training data
- Efficient storage and retrieval of historical data

### 5. Bet365 API Integration

**Objective**: Integrate Bet365 API to fetch odds data and enhance prediction capabilities.

**Implementation Details**:
- Create a Bet365 API client that can:
  - Fetch odds data for various sports and markets
  - Handle authentication and session management
  - Implement rate limiting and error handling
  - Cache responses to reduce API calls

**Technical Approach**:
- Implement a secure authentication mechanism
- Create a modular endpoint system for different markets
- Add data normalization to match ESPN data format
- Implement error handling and retry logic

**Expected Outcome**:
- Real-time odds data for prediction enhancement
- Improved value bet identification
- Better user experience with integrated odds information
