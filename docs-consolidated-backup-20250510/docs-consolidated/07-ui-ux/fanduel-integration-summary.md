# FanDuel Affiliate Integration - Complete Implementation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the FanDuel affiliate integration implementation, including the enhanced micro-transaction workflow.

## Implementation Components

We've successfully implemented a complete FanDuel affiliate integration with three key components:

1. **Core Affiliate Integration**
   - BetNowButton and BetNowPopup components for web and mobile
   - BettingAffiliateContext for app-wide affiliate functionality
   - Team colors database for team-themed buttons

2. **A/B Testing Framework**
   - Firebase Remote Config integration for dynamic button variations
   - Test group assignment based on user ID
   - Comprehensive event tracking for performance analysis

3. **Game URL Integration**
   - GameUrlService that fetches direct URLs from sports APIs
   - Integration with The Odds API, Sports Radar, and ESPN API
   - Automatic URL refreshing to ensure current links

4. **Micro-Transaction Enhancement**
   - OddsButton component that transforms from "Get Odds" to "Bet Now"
   - Stripe integration for in-app purchases
   - Firestore database for tracking user purchases

## Dual Revenue Model

The implementation creates a powerful dual revenue stream:

1. **Direct Revenue**
   - Users pay to access odds information ($1.99 per game)
   - Immediate monetization of sports data

2. **Affiliate Revenue**
   - Post-purchase "Bet Now" buttons with affiliate tracking
   - Commission on bets placed through FanDuel

## GitHub Repository

All code has been committed to GitHub in the `feature/fanduel-affiliate-integration` branch:

- **Core Components**: BetNowButton, BetNowPopup, BettingAffiliateContext
- **Services**: bettingAffiliateService, abTestingService, gameUrlService
- **Documentation**: Implementation guides and testing plans

## Micro-Transaction Workflow

The enhanced workflow combines micro-transactions with affiliate marketing:

1. **Initial State**: User sees "Get Odds" button
2. **Purchase Flow**: User clicks "Get Odds" → prompted to pay via Stripe (in-app micro-transaction)
3. **Post-Purchase**: After successful purchase, the button immediately updates to "Bet Now on FanDuel", dynamically linked with affiliate tracking to FanDuel's specific event

## Implementation Details

### Database Structure

```

            |
            ├── hasPurchased: true
            └── timestamp: "2025-03-17T14:25:00Z"
