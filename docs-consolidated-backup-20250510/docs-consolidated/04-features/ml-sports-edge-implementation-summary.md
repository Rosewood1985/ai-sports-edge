# ML Sports Edge Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the ML Sports Edge API integration into the AI Sports Edge platform. The integration combines data from ESPN and Bet365 to provide accurate sports predictions and value betting opportunities using machine learning.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Data Collection

- **ESPN API Client**: Fetches comprehensive statistical data from ESPN's hidden API
- **Bet365 API Scraper**: Collects real-time odds data from Bet365's API

### 2. Data Processing

- **Data Processor**: Normalizes and merges data from both sources
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts features for machine learning models

### 3. Machine Learning

- **Model Trainer**: Trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models
- **Predictor**: Makes predictions for upcoming games and identifies value bets

### 4. Web Integration

- **ML Sports Edge API Service**: JavaScript service for interacting with the ML Sports Edge API
- **ML Sports Edge Components**: React components for displaying predictions and value bets
- **ML Sports Edge Screen**: Main screen for the ML Sports Edge feature
- **Server-side API Endpoints**: Express routes for handling ML Sports Edge requests
