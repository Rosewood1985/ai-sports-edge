# Testing Strategy for AI Sports Edge

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for AI Sports Edge, including web app functionality testing, Firebase/cloud resources testing, and continuous integration testing.

## Overview

Our testing strategy follows a multi-layered approach to ensure the quality, reliability, and security of the AI Sports Edge platform:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components
3. **Functional Testing**: Testing end-to-end functionality
4. **Performance Testing**: Testing system performance under load
5. **Security Testing**: Testing for vulnerabilities and security issues
6. **Deployment Testing**: Testing the deployment process

## Testing Tools

We use the following tools for testing:

- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing
- **Firebase Emulator**: For testing Firebase functionality locally
- **Lighthouse**: For performance and accessibility testing
- **Custom Scripts**: For deployment and functionality testing

## Web App Functionality Testing

The `scripts/test-webapp-functionality.sh` script performs comprehensive testing of the web app's functionality after deployment. It tests:

### Page Accessibility
- Homepage
- About page
- Sports page
- Login page
- Register page
- 404 page

### API Endpoints
- GET /api/sports
- GET /api/predictions
- POST /api/create-payment (with authentication check)

### Configuration
- Redirects
- Caching headers
- Security headers

### Visual Testing
- Takes screenshots of key pages for visual inspection

### Test Report
- Generates a detailed test report in `test-results/webapp-functionality-test-report.txt`
- Saves screenshots in `test-results/screenshots/`

### Usage

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/test-webapp-functionality.sh

# Run the test
./scripts/test-webapp-functionality.sh
```

## Firebase/Cloud Resources Testing

The `scripts/test-staging-deployment.sh` script tests the Firebase/cloud resources in a staging environment before deploying to production. It tests:

### Deployment
- Deploys to the staging environment
- Verifies successful deployment

### Site Accessibility
- Checks if the site is accessible
- Verifies HTTP status codes

### Security
- Checks security headers
- Verifies HTTPS redirects

### Firebase Configuration
- Verifies Firebase web app configuration

### Test Report
- Generates a detailed test report in `test-results/staging-test-report.txt`

### Usage

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/test-staging-deployment.sh

# Run the test
./scripts/test-staging-deployment.sh
```

## API Key Verification

The `scripts/check-api-keys.sh` script verifies that all necessary API keys are available in the environment. It checks:

### Required API Keys
- Firebase API key
- Stripe API key
- Stripe webhook secret
- Google Maps API key
- OpenWeather API key

### Optional API Keys
- Google Analytics ID
- Sentry DSN
- Algolia App ID and API key

### Usage

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/check-api-keys.sh

# Run the check
./scripts/check-api-keys.sh
```

## Continuous Integration Testing

Our CI/CD pipeline includes automated testing at various stages:

### Pre-commit
- Linting
- Unit tests
- Type checking

### Pull Request
- Integration tests
- Functional tests
- Security scans

### Deployment
- Staging deployment tests
- Web app functionality tests
- Performance tests

## Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage across the codebase:

- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 80%+ coverage
- **Functional Tests**: Cover all critical user flows

## Test Environments

We maintain multiple test environments:

1. **Local**: For development testing using Firebase Emulator
2. **Development**: For feature testing
3. **Staging**: For pre-production testing
4. **Production**: For final verification

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Write Tests First**: Follow test-driven development principles
2. **Isolate Tests**: Ensure tests are independent and don't affect each other
3. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for external services
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for boundary conditions and error scenarios
5. **Automate Testing**: Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
6. **Monitor Test Results**: Track test results and fix failures promptly

## Test Data Management

1. **Use Fake Data**: Generate realistic but fake data for testing
2. **Reset Test Data**: Clean up test data after tests
3. **Separate Test Data**: Keep test data separate from production data

## Security Testing

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scanning for vulnerabilities
2. **Penetration Testing**: Periodic penetration testing
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies
4. **Authentication Testing**: Test authentication and authorization

## Performance Testing

1. **Load Testing**: Test performance under expected load
2. **Stress Testing**: Test performance under extreme load
3. **Endurance Testing**: Test performance over extended periods
4. **Scalability Testing**: Test performance as the system scales

## Accessibility Testing

1. **Automated Checks**: Use tools like Lighthouse for automated checks
2. **Manual Testing**: Perform manual accessibility testing
3. **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with screen readers
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Test keyboard navigation

## Mobile Testing

1. **Responsive Design**: Test on different screen sizes
2. **Mobile Browsers**: Test on different mobile browsers
3. **Native Apps**: Test native app functionality
4. **Offline Mode**: Test offline functionality

## Test Reporting

All tests generate detailed reports that include:

1. **Test Results**: Pass/fail status for each test
2. **Error Details**: Detailed information about failures
3. **Screenshots**: Visual evidence of test results
4. **Performance Metrics**: Timing and resource usage
5. **Recommendations**: Suggestions for fixing issues

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing strategy ensures that AI Sports Edge maintains high quality, reliability, and security. By following these testing practices, we can deliver a robust and user-friendly platform.
