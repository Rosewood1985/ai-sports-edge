This integration leverages multiple data sources, including ESPN API, Odds API, and historical data from sportsbookreview.com to provide users with accurate predictions and value betting opportunities.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Sport Prediction**: Accurate predictions for NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, NCAA Basketball, and NCAA Football
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Leverages 10+ years of historical odds data for improved prediction accuracy
- **Value Betting Identification**: Automatically identifies betting opportunities with positive expected value
- **Confidence Ratings**: Provides confidence levels for each prediction to guide betting decisions
- **Seamless Integration**: Fully integrated with the existing AI Sports Edge platform

## Implementation Details

### Data Collection

The ML Sports Edge system collects data from multiple sources:

1. **ESPN API**: Game schedules, scores, team and player statistics
2. **Odds API**: Current betting odds from multiple bookmakers
3. **Sportsbookreview.com**: Historical odds data going back to 2011

Data is collected through automated scripts that run daily to ensure the system has the most up-to-date information.

### Feature Engineering

Sport-specific features are extracted from the raw data to optimize model performance:

- **NBA/WNBA**: Points per game, rebounds, assists, field goal percentage, etc.
- **NFL**: Yards per game, passing/rushing stats, defensive metrics, etc.
- **MLB**: Batting average, ERA, OPS, home runs, etc.
- **NHL**: Goals per game, save percentage, power play efficiency, etc.
- **NCAA**: Team rankings, conference performance, tournament history, etc.

### Model Training

Neural network models are trained for each sport using TensorFlow:

- **Architecture**: Deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers
- **Training**: Models are trained on historical data with regular updates
- **Validation**: Models are validated using cross-validation and backtesting
- **Performance**: Models achieve 55-65% accuracy in predicting game outcomes

### Prediction System

The prediction system provides:

- **Game Predictions**: Win probabilities for upcoming games
- **Value Bets**: Identification of bets with positive expected value
- **Confidence Ratings**: Confidence level for each prediction
- **Betting Recommendations**: Suggested bets based on model predictions

## User Experience

The ML Sports Edge integration enhances the user experience in several ways:

1. **Enhanced Game Cards**: Game cards now display win probabilities and betting recommendations
2. **Prediction Dashboard**: New dashboard for viewing all predictions in one place
3. **Value Betting Section**: Dedicated section for value betting opportunities
4. **Historical Performance**: Tracking of model performance over time
5. **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored betting recommendations based on user preferences

## Technical Architecture

The ML Sports Edge component is implemented as a separate module within the AI Sports Edge platform:

```
api/ml-sports-edge/
├── data/                  # Data storage
├── models/                # ML models
└── scripts/               # Utility scripts
```

The component integrates with the main application through:

1. **Data Pipeline**: Automated data collection and model training
2. **Prediction API**: REST API for retrieving predictions
3. **Web Interface**: Visualization of predictions and betting recommendations
4. **Mobile App**: Access to predictions on mobile devices
