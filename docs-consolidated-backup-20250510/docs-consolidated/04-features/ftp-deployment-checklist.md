# AI Sports Edge: FTP Deployment Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for deploying the AI Sports Edge application to traditional web hosting via FTP. It documents the entire process from building the application to deploying it via FTP and performing post-deployment verification.

## 1. Pre-deployment Preparation

### Code Review and Testing Recommendations

- [ ] Run all unit tests to ensure code quality
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- [ ] Perform linting to catch potential issues
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
- [ ] Conduct cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness on various screen sizes
- [ ] Test all critical user flows and functionality
- [ ] Verify third-party API integrations are working correctly
- [ ] Check for console errors and warnings

### Environment Configuration Checks

- [ ] Verify all environment variables are properly set for production
- [ ] Ensure API endpoints are configured for production environment
- [ ] Check that feature flags are appropriately set for production
- [ ] Review analytics and monitoring configurations
- [ ] Verify authentication and authorization settings

### Dependency Management

- [ ] Update all dependencies to their latest stable versions
  ```bash
  npm update
  ```
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
  ```bash
  npm audit
  ```
- [ ] Remove any unused dependencies to reduce bundle size
- [ ] Ensure all peer dependencies are correctly installed
- [ ] Verify compatibility between all dependencies

## 2. Build Process

### Required Commands and Expected Outputs

- [ ] Clean previous build artifacts
  ```bash
  rm -rf dist
  ```
- [ ] Run the build command to generate production-ready files
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- [ ] Verify the build completed successfully without errors
- [ ] Check that all expected files are generated in the `dist` directory
- [ ] Verify the bundle size is optimized for production

### Build Optimization Options

- [ ] Enable code splitting for better performance
- [ ] Implement tree shaking to eliminate unused code
- [ ] Optimize images and other assets
- [ ] Minify CSS and JavaScript files
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources
- [ ] Configure proper caching headers

### Common Build Errors and Solutions

- [ ] Memory issues: Increase Node.js memory limit if needed
  ```bash
  export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096
  ```
- [ ] Module not found errors: Check import paths and dependencies
- [ ] TypeScript compilation errors: Fix type issues before building
- [ ] Asset processing errors: Verify file paths and formats
- [ ] Webpack configuration issues: Check for proper configuration

## 3. Configuration for Deployment

### .htaccess Setup for SPA Routing

- [ ] Verify the .htaccess file is properly configured in the dist directory
- [ ] Ensure RewriteEngine is enabled
- [ ] Check that all routes are redirected to index.html
- [ ] Verify file extensions are properly handled
- [ ] Confirm API routes are properly excluded from rewriting
- [ ] Test that direct access to assets works correctly

### Environment-specific Configurations

- [ ] Set production API endpoints
- [ ] Configure error logging for production
- [ ] Set appropriate cache control headers
- [ ] Configure CORS settings for production
- [ ] Set up compression for better performance

### Security Considerations

- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Set up X-XSS-Protection headers
- [ ] Configure X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- [ ] Set X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME sniffing
- [ ] Implement HSTS for secure connections
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in client-side code

## 4. FTP Deployment Process

### File Preparation

- [ ] Create a backup of the current production files
- [ ] Navigate to the dist directory
  ```bash
  cd dist
  ```
- [ ] Create a zip archive for backup purposes
  ```bash
  zip -r ../ai-sports-edge-dist.zip .
  ```
- [ ] Verify all necessary files are included in the dist directory
- [ ] Check file permissions (typically 644 for files, 755 for directories)

### FTP Client Setup and Connection

- [ ] Install and configure an FTP client (FileZilla, Cyberduck, etc.)
- [ ] Gather FTP connection details from hosting provider:
  - FTP server address (e.g., ftp.yourdomain.com)
  - Username
  - Password
  - Port (usually 21 for standard FTP)
- [ ] Connect to the FTP server
- [ ] Navigate to the appropriate directory on the server (usually public_html, www, or htdocs)

### Upload Procedures and Best Practices

- [ ] Consider creating a backup directory on the server for the current files
- [ ] Upload all files from the dist directory to the server
- [ ] Maintain the directory structure during upload
- [ ] Ensure the .htaccess file is uploaded in ASCII mode (not binary)
- [ ] Verify file permissions after upload
  - Files: 644 (rw-r--r--)
  - Directories: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
  - .htaccess: 644 (rw-r--r--)
- [ ] Handle large files with appropriate timeout settings

### Post-upload Verification

- [ ] Verify all files were uploaded successfully
- [ ] Check file permissions on the server
- [ ] Ensure the .htaccess file is properly uploaded and not corrupted
- [ ] Verify directory structure is maintained
- [ ] Check that index.html is accessible at the root URL

## 5. Post-deployment Tasks

### Testing the Live Application

- [ ] Access the website through its domain name
- [ ] Verify the homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Test navigation and client-side routing
- [ ] Check that all assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) load properly
- [ ] Test all critical user flows
- [ ] Verify third-party integrations work in production
- [ ] Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness on various devices

### Monitoring for Issues

- [ ] Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket)
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Monitor server logs for errors
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical issues
- [ ] Track user behavior with analytics

### Backup Procedures

- [ ] Create a backup of the deployed files
- [ ] Document the current version and deployment date
- [ ] Store backups in a secure location
- [ ] Implement a regular backup schedule
- [ ] Test restoration from backups

## 6. Rollback Procedures

### When to Roll Back a Deployment

- [ ] Critical functionality is broken
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- [ ] Performance issues severely impact user experience
- [ ] Data integrity issues are detected
- [ ] Compliance or legal issues arise

### How to Roll Back

- [ ] Connect to the FTP server
- [ ] Rename or move the current deployment to a backup directory
- [ ] Upload the previous version from backup
- [ ] Verify file permissions
- [ ] Test the rollback to ensure functionality is restored
- [ ] Document the rollback process and reasons

### Maintaining Previous Versions

- [ ] Keep at least the last 3 versions of the application
- [ ] Document changes between versions
- [ ] Store previous versions with clear naming conventions
- [ ] Implement a version retention policy
- [ ] Regularly clean up old versions according to the retention policy

## Deployment Verification Checklist

Use this quick checklist after deployment to verify everything is working correctly:

- [ ] Website loads at the correct URL
- [ ] All pages are accessible through navigation
- [ ] Direct access to routes works (client-side routing)
- [ ] All assets load correctly (no 404 errors)
- [ ] Forms and interactive elements work as expected
- [ ] Third-party integrations function properly
- [ ] Website is responsive on mobile devices
- [ ] No console errors are present
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (load times, interactions)
- [ ] Analytics are tracking correctly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Routing Issues

- **Problem**: 404 errors when accessing routes directly
- **Solution**: Verify .htaccess configuration and ensure mod_rewrite is enabled on the server

### Missing Assets

- **Problem**: Images, CSS, or JavaScript files not loading
- **Solution**: Check file paths, ensure files were uploaded, verify permissions

### Permission Issues

- **Problem**: Access denied or forbidden errors
- **Solution**: Check file and directory permissions, typically 644 for files and 755 for directories

### CORS Issues

- **Problem**: API requests failing due to CORS
- **Solution**: Configure proper CORS headers in .htaccess or server configuration

### Performance Issues

- **Problem**: Slow page loading
- **Solution**: Verify compression is enabled, check for large assets, implement caching

## Conclusion

Following this comprehensive checklist will ensure a smooth deployment process for the AI Sports Edge application via FTP. Regular updates to this document should be made as the deployment process evolves or new challenges are encountered.
