# Betting Analytics Implementation

## Overview

The Betting Analytics feature provides users with comprehensive insights into their betting history and performance. This feature helps users track their betting patterns, analyze their success rates, and make more informed decisions for future bets.

## Key Components

### 1. Betting Analytics Service

The core of this feature is the `BettingAnalyticsService` class, which provides the following functionality:

- **Bet Tracking**: Records and manages user bet history
- **Performance Analysis**: Calculates win rates, ROI, and profit/loss metrics
- **Trend Identification**: Identifies patterns in betting behavior
- **Filtering**: Allows filtering by time period, bet type, sport, etc.
- **Firestore Integration**: Stores and retrieves bet data from Firebase Firestore

### 2. User Interface Components

- **BettingAnalytics Component**: Displays analytics data in a user-friendly format
- **BettingAnalyticsScreen**: Dedicated screen for the analytics feature
- **Settings Integration**: Access to the feature through the app's settings menu

## Technical Implementation

### Data Model

The betting analytics feature uses a comprehensive data model to track bets:

- **BetRecord**: Represents a single bet with details like amount, odds, result, etc.
- **BetType**: Enum for different types of bets (moneyline, spread, over/under, etc.)
- **BetStatus**: Enum for bet status (pending, settled, cancelled)
- **BetResult**: Enum for bet outcome (win, loss, push, void)
- **AnalyticsSummary**: Aggregated metrics and insights from bet history

### Analytics Calculations

The service performs various calculations to provide meaningful insights:

1. **Win Rate**: Percentage of bets that resulted in wins
2. **ROI (Return on Investment)**: Net profit as a percentage of total amount wagered
3. **Net Profit**: Total winnings minus total amount wagered
4. **Streaks**: Current and longest winning/losing streaks
5. **Bet Type Analysis**: Performance breakdown by bet type

### Firestore Integration

Bet records are stored in a Firestore collection with the following structure:

```
bets/
  ├── [bet_id]/
  │     ├── userId: string
  │     ├── gameId: string
  │     ├── teamId: string
  │     ├── betType: BetType
  │     ├── amount: number
  │     ├── odds: number
  │     ├── potentialWinnings: number
  │     ├── status: BetStatus
  │     ├── result: BetResult
  │     ├── createdAt: Timestamp
  │     ├── settledAt: Timestamp
  │     ├── notes: string
  │     ├── tags: string[]
  │     ├── sport: string
  │     ├── league: string
  │     ├── teamName: string
  │     ├── opponentName: string
  │     └── gameDate: Timestamp
```

### Time Period Filtering

The analytics can be filtered by different time periods:

- Today
- Week (last 7 days)
- Month (last 30 days)
- Year (last 365 days)
- All time

## User Interface

The UI for betting analytics is organized into several sections:

1. **Summary Card**: Displays key metrics like total bets, win rate, total wagered, and net profit
2. **Recent Form**: Shows results of the most recent bets
3. **Bet Type Breakdown**: Analyzes performance by bet type
4. **Most Bet**: Identifies most frequently bet sports and teams
5. **Best & Worst Bets**: Highlights the most successful and unsuccessful bets

## Integration Points

The betting analytics feature integrates with several existing systems:

1. **Firebase Authentication**: Ensures users can only access their own betting data
2. **Firestore Database**: Stores and retrieves betting records
3. **Navigation System**: Added to the app's navigation stack
4. **Settings Menu**: Accessible through a dedicated section in settings
5. **Theming System**: Leverages ThemedView and ThemedText for consistent styling

## Security Considerations

The betting analytics feature implements several security measures:

1. **User-Specific Data**: Each bet record is associated with a user ID
2. **Authentication Checks**: All database operations verify the user is authenticated
3. **Authorization Validation**: Users can only access and modify their own bet records
4. **Data Validation**: Input validation ensures data integrity

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the betting analytics feature include:

1. **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs for better data visualization
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Machine learning to suggest optimal betting strategies
3. **Export Functionality**: Ability to export betting history and analytics
4. **Notifications**: Alerts for significant trends or milestones
5. **Social Sharing**: Option to share betting performance with friends
