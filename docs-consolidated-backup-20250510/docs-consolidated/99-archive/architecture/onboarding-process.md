# Onboarding Process Documentation

This document provides an overview of the onboarding process in AI Sports Edge, including its implementation, internationalization, and accessibility features.

## Overview

The onboarding process is a critical part of the user experience, introducing new users to the app's features and functionality. It consists of a series of slides that users can navigate through to learn about the app's key features.

The onboarding process is implemented in both the web app and iOS app, with support for multiple languages (currently English and Spanish).

## Implementation

### iOS App

The iOS app's onboarding process is implemented in the following files:

- `screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx`: The main screen component that displays the onboarding slides
- `components/OnboardingSlide.tsx`: A component for rendering individual slides
- `services/onboardingService.ts`: A service for managing onboarding state and analytics
- `services/analyticsService.ts`: A service for tracking analytics events
- `translations/en.json` and `translations/es.json`: Translation files for English and Spanish

### Web App

The web app's onboarding process is implemented in the following files:

- `web/pages/OnboardingPage.js`: The main page component that displays the onboarding slides
- `web/services/onboardingService.js`: A service for managing onboarding state and analytics
- `web/services/analyticsService.js`: A service for tracking analytics events
- `public/locales/en/onboarding.json` and `public/locales/es/onboarding.json`: Translation files for English and Spanish

## Features

### Multi-language Support

The onboarding process supports multiple languages through the use of translation files. Currently, English and Spanish are supported, but additional languages can be added by creating new translation files.

Key translation features:
- Separate translation files for each language
- Fallback to English for missing translations
- Language detection based on device settings
- Manual language selection

### Accessibility

The onboarding process is designed to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Key accessibility features include:

- Screen reader support with descriptive labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Proper focus management
- High contrast text
- Semantic HTML/React Native elements
- ARIA attributes for web

### Analytics

The onboarding process includes analytics tracking to help understand how users interact with the onboarding process. Key analytics events include:

- `onboarding_started`: Triggered when a user starts the onboarding process
- `onboarding_step`: Triggered when a user views a specific onboarding step
- `onboarding_completed`: Triggered when a user completes the onboarding process

### Error Handling

The onboarding process includes robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience even in the face of errors. Key error handling features include:

- Graceful degradation when storage is unavailable
- Fallback mechanisms for storing onboarding state
- User-friendly error messages
- Continued navigation even when errors occur

## Technical Details

### Storage

The onboarding process uses different storage mechanisms depending on the platform:

- iOS app: AsyncStorage for persistent storage
- Web app: localStorage with sessionStorage as a backup

### Navigation

The onboarding process uses different navigation mechanisms depending on the platform:

- iOS app: React Navigation
- Web app: React Router

### Analytics

The onboarding process uses a unified analytics interface that works across platforms:

- iOS app: Firebase Analytics
- Web app: Google Analytics (gtag.js)

## Best Practices

When making changes to the onboarding process, follow these best practices:

1. **Maintain translations**: Ensure all text is properly translated in all supported languages
2. **Test accessibility**: Verify that changes maintain or improve accessibility
3. **Handle errors gracefully**: Ensure errors don't block the user from proceeding
4. **Track analytics**: Add appropriate analytics tracking for new features
5. **Test cross-platform**: Verify changes work on both web and iOS platforms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Translation keys not found**: Ensure translation keys match between code and translation files
2. **Storage errors**: Check for storage permission issues or storage limits
3. **Navigation errors**: Verify navigation paths and parameters
4. **Analytics not tracking**: Check analytics configuration and network connectivity

### Debugging

To debug the onboarding process:

1. Enable development mode logging
2. Check browser/device console for errors
3. Use React/React Native debugging tools
4. Test with different languages and devices

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements to the onboarding process include:

1. Adding support for more languages
2. Implementing A/B testing for different onboarding flows
3. Adding more interactive elements to the onboarding slides
4. Implementing a skip and resume feature for returning users
5. Adding more detailed analytics tracking
