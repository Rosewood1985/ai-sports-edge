## Deployment

### Process

Deployment uses GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to Firebase hosting when changes are pushed to main branch.

Firebase services have been refactored to follow atomic architecture principles. The implementation is in src/atomic with atoms (firebaseApp), molecules (firebaseAuth, firebaseFirestore, etc.), and organisms (firebaseService). Documentation is in src/atomic/README.md and a commit graph is in docs/firebase-atomic-commit-graph.md.
