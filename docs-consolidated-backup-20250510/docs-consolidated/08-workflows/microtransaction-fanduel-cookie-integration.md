## FanDuel Cookie Integration

To ensure a seamless user experience when transitioning from our app to the FanDuel betting platform, we've implemented a cookie-based tracking system. This system allows us to maintain user context when they switch from our app to FanDuel, enabling better conversion tracking and a more personalized experience.

### Implementation Details

1. **Cookie Initialization**:
   - Cookies are initialized when users view odds, click on betting buttons, or see betting popups
   - Cookies store user ID, game ID, team ID, and other relevant information
   - Cookies are stored using AsyncStorage for persistence across sessions

2. **URL Generation with Cookies**:
   - When users click on "Bet Now" or "Get Odds" buttons, the app generates URLs with cookie parameters
   - These parameters are appended to the FanDuel URL to maintain context
   - Parameters include affiliate ID, user ID, game ID, and team ID

3. **Tracking Interactions**:
   - All interactions with betting buttons and popups are tracked
   - This includes impressions, clicks, conversions, and dismissals
   - Data is used to optimize conversion rates and improve user experience

4. **Integration Points**:
   - **OddsButton**: Initializes cookies when users purchase odds and redirects to FanDuel
   - **BetNowButton**: Uses cookies for tracking and redirecting to FanDuel
   - **BetNowPopup**: Initializes cookies when shown and tracks user interactions

### Benefits

1. **Improved Conversion Tracking**: Better attribution of conversions to specific features and interactions
2. **Seamless User Experience**: Users don't lose context when switching to FanDuel
3. **Personalized Betting Experience**: FanDuel can provide a more personalized experience based on the context
4. **Increased Revenue**: Higher conversion rates lead to increased affiliate revenue
5. **Better Analytics**: More detailed data on user behavior and preferences
