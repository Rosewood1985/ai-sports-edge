# Security Plan

This document outlines the security strategy for AI Sports Edge, including penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and API rate limiting.

## Overview

The security plan consists of the following components:

1. **Penetration Testing**: Professional penetration testing to identify security vulnerabilities
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning of code, dependencies, and infrastructure
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Production-grade rate limiting to protect the API from abuse

## Penetration Testing

Penetration testing is conducted to identify security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

### Components

- **Network Scanning**: Identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities
- **Web Application Testing**: Test for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **API Testing**: Test API endpoints for security issues
- **Database Testing**: Test for SQL injection and other database vulnerabilities

### Workflow

1. Reconnaissance and information gathering
2. Vulnerability scanning
3. Manual testing and exploitation
4. Reporting and documentation

### Commands

```bash
# Initialize penetration testing configuration
./infrastructure/security/penetration-testing.sh --init

# Run all penetration tests
./infrastructure/security/penetration-testing.sh --run-all

# Generate penetration testing report
./infrastructure/security/penetration-testing.sh --generate-report
```

## Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is conducted to identify known vulnerabilities in the application code, dependencies, and infrastructure.

### Components

- **Code Scanning**: Static analysis of source code
- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries
- **Docker Image Scanning**: Check for vulnerabilities in container images
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Check for vulnerabilities in infrastructure as code

### Workflow

1. Scan code for vulnerabilities
2. Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
3. Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
4. Generate vulnerability report

### Commands

```bash
# Initialize vulnerability scanning configuration
./infrastructure/security/vulnerability-scanning.sh --init

# Run all vulnerability scans
./infrastructure/security/vulnerability-scanning.sh --run-all

# Generate vulnerability scanning report
./infrastructure/security/vulnerability-scanning.sh --generate-report
```

## API Rate Limiting

API rate limiting is implemented to protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage.

### Components

- **Global Rate Limiting**: Limit the overall number of requests
- **Endpoint-Specific Rate Limiting**: Different limits for different endpoints
- **User Tier-Based Rate Limiting**: Different limits for different user tiers
- **IP Whitelisting**: Allow unlimited access for trusted IPs

### Implementation Options

- **Nginx**: Server-level rate limiting
- **AWS API Gateway**: Cloud-based rate limiting
- **Redis**: Distributed rate limiting
- **Express.js Middleware**: Application-level rate limiting

### Commands

```bash
# Initialize rate limiting configuration
./infrastructure/security/api-rate-limiting.sh --init

# Configure Nginx rate limiting
./infrastructure/security/api-rate-limiting.sh --nginx

# Configure AWS API Gateway rate limiting
./infrastructure/security/api-rate-limiting.sh --api-gateway

# Configure Redis for rate limiting
./infrastructure/security/api-rate-limiting.sh --redis

# Configure Express.js rate limiting
./infrastructure/security/api-rate-limiting.sh --express

# Configure all rate limiting components
./infrastructure/security/api-rate-limiting.sh --all
```

## Integrated Security Management

The main security management script orchestrates all security components for a streamlined security assessment process.

### Commands

```bash
# Initialize all security components
./infrastructure/security/security-management.sh --init

# Run penetration testing
./infrastructure/security/security-management.sh --pentest

# Run vulnerability scanning
./infrastructure/security/security-management.sh --vulnscan

# Configure API rate limiting
./infrastructure/security/security-management.sh --ratelimit

# Run all security assessments
./infrastructure/security/security-management.sh --all

# Generate comprehensive security report
./infrastructure/security/security-management.sh --generate-report

# Schedule regular security assessments
./infrastructure/security/security-management.sh --schedule
```

## Security Assessment Schedule

Regular security assessments are scheduled to ensure ongoing security:

- **Penetration Testing**: Monthly
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Weekly
- **Security Report Generation**: Monthly

## Security Best Practices

In addition to the automated security assessments, the following best practices should be followed:

1. **Secure Coding Practices**:
   - Input validation
   - Output encoding
   - Parameterized queries
   - Proper error handling

2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Strong password policies
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - JWT token security

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Encryption in transit (HTTPS)
   - Encryption at rest
   - Data minimization
   - Secure data deletion

4. **Infrastructure Security**:
   - Least privilege principle
   - Network segmentation
   - Firewall configuration
   - Regular patching

5. **Monitoring and Incident Response**:
   - Security logging
   - Intrusion detection
   - Incident response plan
   - Regular security drills

## Conclusion

This security plan provides a comprehensive approach to securing AI Sports Edge. By implementing penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and API rate limiting, along with following security best practices, we can ensure the security of our systems and protect our users' data.
