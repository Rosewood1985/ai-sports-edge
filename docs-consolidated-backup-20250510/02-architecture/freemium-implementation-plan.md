# AI Sports Edge: Freemium Model Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for converting AI Sports Edge into a freemium application. The freemium model will provide free users with valuable but limited content while encouraging upgrades to premium subscriptions.

## Core Architecture

### User Access Levels

1. **Free User**
   - Access to limited features with strategic upgrade prompts
   - Ad-supported content
   - Time-based unlocks (daily free picks)

2. **Premium User**
   - Full access to all features
   - No ads
   - Unlimited usage

3. **One-Time Purchase User**
   - Temporary access to specific premium features
   - Time-limited (24-48 hours)

### Freemium Feature Matrix

| Feature | Free Users | Premium Users |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| AI Picks | 1 daily pick (with ad) | Unlimited picks |
| Predictions | Blurred/limited | Full access |
| Trending Bets | Basic trends | AI insights |
| Community Polls | Vote & view results | Compare with AI |
| Live Scores | Basic scores | AI-driven insights |
| Bet Tracker | Manual entry | Auto-tracking + AI analysis |
| Game Previews | Basic stats | AI best bets |
| Betting Guide | Beginner tips | Advanced strategies |

## Implementation Components

### 1. FreemiumFeature Component
