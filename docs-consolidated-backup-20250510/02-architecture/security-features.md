## DDoS Protection

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection is implemented to prevent attackers from overwhelming the application with traffic.

### Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests from a single IP address
- **Speed Limiting**: Gradually slows down responses for IPs making too many requests
- **IP Filtering**: Blocks or allows specific IP addresses
- **Suspicious Request Detection**: Identifies and logs potentially malicious requests

### Implementation

The DDoS protection is implemented using the `ddosProtection.js` module, which provides:

```javascript
// Configure DDoS protection middleware
const middleware = configureDdosProtection({
  rateWindow: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  rateMax: 100, // 100 requests per window
  speedWindow: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  speedDelay: 500, // 500ms delay after threshold
  speedDelayAfter: 50, // Start delaying after 50 requests
  trustProxy: true, // Trust X-Forwarded-For header
  blacklist: [], // IP blacklist
  whitelist: [], // IP whitelist
});

// Apply middleware to Express app
app.use(middleware);
```

## Security Headers

Security headers are implemented to protect against various web vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, and content injection.

### Features

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts which resources can be loaded
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Forces HTTPS connections
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Provides XSS protection for older browsers
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls the Referer header
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts which browser features can be used

### Implementation

The security headers are implemented using the `securityHeaders.js` module, which provides:

```javascript
// Configure security headers middleware
const middleware = configureSecurityHeaders({
  // Content Security Policy options
  enableCSP: true,
  reportOnly: false,
  defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
  scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'", 'https://www.google-analytics.com'],
  styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", 'https://fonts.googleapis.com'],
  imgSrc: ["'self'", 'data:', 'https://www.google-analytics.com'],
  fontSrc: ["'self'", 'https://fonts.gstatic.com'],
  connectSrc: ["'self'", 'https://www.google-analytics.com', 'https://api.aisportsedge.com'],
  
  // Other security header options
  enableHSTS: true,
  hstsMaxAge: 15552000, // 180 days
  enableXFrame: true,
  xFrameOption: 'SAMEORIGIN',
  enableXContentType: true,
  enableXXSS: true,
  enableReferrerPolicy: true,
  referrerPolicy: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
});

// Apply middleware to Express app
app.use(middleware);
```

## Audit Logging

Audit logging is implemented to track security-relevant events and provide a trail for forensic analysis.

### Features

- **Comprehensive Event Logging**: Logs authentication, authorization, data access, and system events
- **Tamper Detection**: Adds cryptographic hashes to log entries to detect tampering
- **Sensitive Data Filtering**: Masks sensitive information in logs
- **Log Integrity Verification**: Provides tools to verify the integrity of log files
- **Express Middleware**: Automatically logs HTTP requests and responses

### Implementation

The audit logging is implemented using the `auditLogging.js` module, which provides:

```javascript
// Create a security logger
const securityLogger = createSecurityLogger({
  logDir: './logs',
  logLevel: 'info',
  maxSize: '10m',
  maxFiles: 10,
  enableConsole: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
  enableFile: true,
  enableTamperProtection: true,
});

// Log a security event
logSecurityEvent(
  SecurityEventType.LOGIN_SUCCESS,
  'User logged in successfully',
  {
    userId: 'user123',
    ipAddress: '192.168.1.1',
    userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0...',
  }
);

// Create audit middleware for Express
const auditMiddleware = createAuditMiddleware({
  excludePaths: ['/health', '/metrics'],
  logBody: false,
  logHeaders: true,
  sensitiveHeaders: ['authorization', 'cookie', 'x-api-key'],
  sensitiveParams: ['password', 'token', 'key', 'secret'],
});

// Apply middleware to Express app
app.use(auditMiddleware);
```

## Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is implemented to identify security issues in the application code and dependencies.

### Features

- **Dependency Scanning**: Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Configuration Scanning**: Identifies insecure configurations
- **Secret Scanning**: Detects hardcoded secrets in the codebase
- **Static Analysis**: Analyzes code for security issues
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Tests running application for vulnerabilities

### Implementation

The vulnerability scanning is implemented using the `vulnerability-scan.js` script, which provides:

```javascript
// Run npm audit to check for vulnerable dependencies
await runNpmAudit();

// Check for insecure configurations
await checkInsecureConfigs();

// Scan for hardcoded secrets
await scanForSecrets();

// Run ESLint with security plugins
await runEslintSecurity();

// Run SonarQube analysis
await runSonarQube();

// Run OWASP ZAP for dynamic scanning
await runOwaspZap();
```

## Implementation Details

The security features are implemented in the following files:

1. `server/ddosProtection.js`: Provides DDoS protection middleware
2. `server/securityHeaders.js`: Configures security headers for the application
3. `server/auditLogging.js`: Implements comprehensive security audit logging
4. `scripts/vulnerability-scan.js`: Performs vulnerability scanning

These modules are designed to work together to provide a comprehensive security solution for the application.

## Best Practices

When working with the security features, follow these best practices:

### DDoS Protection

- Adjust rate limits based on expected traffic patterns
- Use IP whitelisting for trusted sources
- Monitor and analyze rate limit events to identify potential attacks
- Consider using a CDN or dedicated DDoS protection service for large-scale applications

### Security Headers

- Regularly review and update CSP directives as the application evolves
- Use CSP in report-only mode initially to identify issues
- Test the application thoroughly after implementing security headers
- Consider using a security headers scanner to verify implementation

### Audit Logging

- Regularly review security logs for suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for critical security events
- Ensure logs are stored securely and retained for an appropriate period
- Implement log rotation to manage disk space
- Consider forwarding logs to a centralized logging system

### Vulnerability Scanning

- Run vulnerability scans regularly, ideally as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- Address high and critical vulnerabilities promptly
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Implement a vulnerability management process
- Consider using multiple scanning tools for better coverage

### General

- Follow the principle of defense in depth
- Regularly update security measures as new threats emerge
- Conduct security training for developers
- Perform regular security assessments
- Stay informed about security best practices and vulnerabilities

## Conclusion

The security features implemented in AI Sports Edge provide a robust defense against various threats. By following the best practices outlined in this document, you can ensure that the application remains secure and protected from evolving security threats.
