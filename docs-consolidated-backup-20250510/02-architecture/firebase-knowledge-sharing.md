```bash
./scripts/firebase-knowledge-sharing.sh <command>
```

Available commands:

- `tips`: Create Firebase tips document
- `training <topic>`: Create training presentation (auth, firestore, storage, functions, analytics)
- `exercises <topic>`: Create training exercises (auth, firestore, storage, functions, analytics)
- `checklist`: Create code review checklist
- `faq`: Create Firebase FAQ

5. **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics

## Integration with Memory Bank

The Firebase Knowledge Sharing System integrates with the project's memory bank to store information about the knowledge sharing materials. This allows the team to easily find and reference the materials when needed.

## Maintenance

The Firebase Knowledge Sharing System should be maintained and updated as the Firebase service evolves. New tips, training materials, and exercises should be added as needed to keep the system up-to-date.

## Contributing

Team members are encouraged to contribute to the Firebase Knowledge Sharing System by:

1. Adding new tips to the Firebase Tips and Tricks document
2. Creating new training materials for additional Firebase topics
3. Developing new exercises to help team members practice using the Firebase service
4. Updating existing materials to reflect changes in the Firebase service

## Conclusion

The Firebase Knowledge Sharing System is a valuable resource for the team to learn and use the consolidated Firebase service effectively. By providing comprehensive documentation, training materials, and exercises, the system helps ensure consistent usage of the Firebase service across the project and facilitates knowledge sharing among team members.
