  - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
  - `invoice.payment_failed`

### Client-Side Components

- Two implementations:
  - `subscriptionService.ts`: Mock implementation using AsyncStorage (likely for development/testing)
  - `firebaseSubscriptionService.ts`: Production implementation using Firebase

✅ **Subscription Plans**

- Alert Packages
- Player Plus-Minus Data

✅ **Additional Features**

## Planned But Not Yet Implemented Features

Based on the documentation and code comments, there are a few features that have been planned but not fully implemented:

1. **Family Plans**: The documentation mentions plans to create family plans that allow users to share subscriptions with family members.

2. **Subscription Bundles**: There are plans to create bundled offerings that combine different features.

3. **Usage-Based Billing**: The documentation mentions implementing metered billing for certain features.

4. **Subscription Analytics Dashboard**: While there is backend support for subscription analytics, a comprehensive dashboard for viewing this data may not be fully implemented.

5. **Redeeming Gift Subscriptions**: While the `giftSubscription` function is implemented, the corresponding `redeemGiftSubscription` function appears to be missing from the implementation.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Implement Family Plans**: This could be a valuable feature for increasing subscription revenue by allowing users to share access with family members at a discounted rate.

2. **Create Subscription Bundles**: Bundling different features could provide more value to users and increase conversion rates.

3. **Add Usage-Based Billing**: For certain premium features, implementing metered billing could provide more flexibility and potentially increase revenue.

4. **Complete Gift Subscription Flow**: Implement the `redeemGiftSubscription` function to complete the gift subscription feature.

5. **Enhance Subscription Analytics**: Develop a comprehensive dashboard for viewing subscription metrics and trends.

6. **Implement A/B Testing**: Set up A/B testing for subscription plans and pricing to optimize conversion rates.

## Conclusion

The Stripe integration and subscription system are well-implemented with a comprehensive set of features. The codebase shows a thoughtful approach to subscription management, with support for various subscription models, one-time purchases, and microtransactions.

The planned features mentioned in the documentation would further enhance the subscription system and potentially increase revenue. Implementing these features should be prioritized based on business goals and user needs.
