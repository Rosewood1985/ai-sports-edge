# Frontend Blockers Fixed âœ…

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Integrity and Crossorigin Attributes
- Removed `crossorigin` attribute from Google Fonts links in:
  - `/dist/index.html`
  - `/dist/login.html`
- Prevents integrity check failures that block font loading

### 2. Disabled Service Worker
- Commented out service worker registration script in `index.html`
- Removed `service-worker.js` file
- Eliminates CSP conflicts with service workers

### 3. Updated Content Security Policy
- Removed inline CSP `<meta>` tags from HTML files
- Added proper CSP in `.htaccess`:
  ```
  <IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set Content-Security-Policy "script-src 'self' https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com"
  </IfModule>
  ```
- Ensures consistent CSP application across all pages

### 4. Fixed MIME Types
- Ensured all `.js` scripts are served with proper MIME types
- Removed potential MIME type mismatches

### 5. Optimized Firebase Initialization
- Moved Firebase config to load after `DOMContentLoaded`
- Added detailed error logging for Firebase initialization

## Verification Steps
1. Visit https://aisportsedge.app in incognito mode
2. Check browser console for any CSP or MIME errors
3. Confirm Firebase authentication works
4. Test language toggle functionality
5. Verify routing between pages

## Deployment
- Rebuilt `/dist` directory with `npx expo export --platform web`
- Deployed using secure SFTP script: `./scripts/secure-sftp-deploy.sh`

## Next Steps
- Monitor error logs for any remaining issues
- Consider implementing a more robust CSP policy with nonces for inline scripts
- Add automated testing for CSP compliance
