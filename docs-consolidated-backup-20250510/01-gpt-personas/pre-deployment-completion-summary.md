## Critical Path and Dependencies

1. **Push Notifications & Deep Linking** must be completed before final UI/UX polishing
2. **Offline Mode** is a prerequisite for the iOS App Store submission
3. **A/B Testing Framework** should be in place before deployment to enable immediate testing
4. **Machine Learning Integration** can be deployed in phases, with basic predictions available at launch
5. **Additional Data Sources** integration can be prioritized by sport/league based on seasonal relevance

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
- **App Store Review**: Potential rejection due to betting-related content
  - *Mitigation*: Clearly document educational purpose and compliance with guidelines
- **ML Model Accuracy**: Initial predictions may have lower accuracy until more data is collected
  - *Mitigation*: Clearly label confidence levels and implement feedback mechanisms
- **API Rate Limits**: Multiple data sources may hit rate limits during high-traffic periods
  - *Mitigation*: Implement robust caching and fallback data sources

### Medium-Risk Areas
- **Performance on Older Devices**: Rich data visualizations may impact performance
  - *Mitigation*: Implement progressive enhancement and device-specific optimizations
- **User Adoption of Premium Features**: Conversion rate uncertainty
  - *Mitigation*: Implement A/B testing framework early to optimize conversion
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensuring consistent experience across web and iOS
  - *Mitigation*: Shared component library and comprehensive testing

## Success Criteria for Launch

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - App startup time < 2 seconds on target devices
   - API response time < 500ms for 95% of requests
   - Crash-free sessions > 99.5%

2. **User Experience Metrics**:
   - Core task completion rate > 90%
