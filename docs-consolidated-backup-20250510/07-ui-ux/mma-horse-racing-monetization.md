3. **Consideration**: Users are presented with two options:
   - Subscribe to Premium for full access to all features
   - Purchase one-time access for the specific content they're interested in
4. **Conversion**: Users either upgrade their subscription or make a microtransaction
5. **Retention**: Premium content keeps users engaged and subscribed
