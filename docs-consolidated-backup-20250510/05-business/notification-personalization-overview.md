## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced User Notification Preferences

Users can customize their notification experience with the following preferences:

- **Notification Types**: Enable/disable different types of notifications (predictions, value bets, game reminders, model performance, RSS alerts).
- **Frequency Controls**: Set the frequency of notifications (low, normal, high).
- **Quiet Hours**: Specify hours during which notifications should not be sent.
- **Maximum Notifications**: Set a maximum number of notifications per day.
- **Priority Only**: Only receive high-priority notifications.
- **Content Preferences**: Choose what content to include in notifications (odds, stats, news).
- **Channel Preferences**: Select which channels to receive notifications on (push, email, in-app).
- **RSS Feed Alerts**: Configure RSS feed notification preferences (favorite teams only, favorite players only, keyword alerts).

### 2. Notification Content Personalization

Notifications are personalized based on user preferences and interests:

- **Favorite Team Highlighting**: Notifications highlight the user's favorite teams.
- **Odds Format**: Odds are displayed in the user's preferred format (American, decimal, fractional).
- **Dynamic Content**: Notification content is dynamically generated based on user preferences.
- **Template System**: A template system allows for consistent, personalized notification content.

### 3. Notification Delivery Optimization

Notification delivery is optimized to respect user preferences and maximize engagement:

- **Time-Based Delivery**: Notifications respect quiet hours and are sent at appropriate times.
- **Frequency Management**: The system limits the number of notifications to prevent notification fatigue.
- **Notification Prioritization**: Notifications are prioritized based on user interests and behavior.
- **Channel Selection**: Notifications are sent through the user's preferred channels.

### 4. RSS Feed Integration

The RSS feed system is integrated with the notification system to provide timely, relevant news updates:

- **Team and Player Extraction**: The system extracts teams and players mentioned in RSS feed items.
- **Betting Opportunity Detection**: The system identifies betting opportunities in RSS feed items.
- **Injury Information Extraction**: The system extracts injury information from RSS feed items.
- **Game Information Extraction**: The system extracts game information from RSS feed items.
- **Relevance Scoring**: RSS feed items are scored based on relevance to the user.

### 5. Analytics and Optimization

The system includes analytics and optimization features to improve the notification experience:

- **Engagement Tracking**: The system tracks user engagement with notifications.
- **User Behavior Analytics**: User behavior is analyzed to improve personalization.
- **Automatic Optimization**: The system automatically optimizes notification content and delivery based on user behavior.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: An analytics dashboard provides insights into notification performance.
