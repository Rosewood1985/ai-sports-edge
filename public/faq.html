                    Parlay odds are calculated by multiplying the odds of each individual bet together. For example, if you have three bets at +100 odds each, the parlay would pay approximately +700. Our AI helps identify correlated picks that work well together in parlays.

                    A teaser allows you to adjust point spreads in your favor across multiple games, but offers lower payouts than traditional parlays. Teasers are typically used for football and basketball, allowing you to move spreads by 6, 6.5, or 7 points.
