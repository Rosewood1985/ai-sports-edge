feat(accessibility): Enhance UFCScreen with accessibility features

- Replace standard components with AccessibleThemedView, AccessibleThemedText, and AccessibleTouchableOpacity
- Add proper accessibility attributes (labels, roles, hints, states) to all interactive elements
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy with semantic types
- Fix Firebase auth type issues
- Maintain consistent accessibility patterns with other screens
- Update progress tracking in memory-bank

This implementation follows the patterns established in ProfileScreen.tsx (commit 9089eee),
ensuring consistency across the application and improving the experience for users with disabilities.
