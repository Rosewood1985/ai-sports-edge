# AI Sports Edge Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the implementation of key features in the AI Sports Edge app, including the Knowledge Edge screen, betting slip feature, backend services, and React components library. These implementations follow atomic design principles and provide a solid foundation for the app's functionality.

## Knowledge Edge Screen

The Knowledge Edge screen provides users with comprehensive educational content about sports betting concepts, strategies, and terminology. It follows atomic design principles with a clean, modern interface featuring neon blue borders and interactive elements.

### Key Features

- **Atomic Design Structure**: Implemented with atoms, molecules, and organisms
- **Neon Border Animations**: Animated borders with glowing effects and rotation
- **Interactive Educational Content**: Expandable articles with detailed information
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of learning progress
- **Category Filtering**: Filter content by category (All, Guides, Glossary, FAQ)
- **Search Functionality**: Search across all content types
- **Migrated FAQ Content**: Content migrated from the previous FAQScreen

For detailed information, see [Knowledge Edge Implementation Summary](knowledge-edge-implementation-summary.md).

## Betting Slip Feature

The Betting Slip feature allows users to track their betting performance by manually entering bet slips, using quick entry, or scanning bet slips with their camera (for premium tiers). This feature is designed to help users analyze their betting patterns, identify profitable strategies, and improve their overall betting performance.

### Frontend Components

### Backend Components

- **Database Models (Prisma Schema)**: User, BetSlip, BetLeg, OCRUpload, UserAnalytics
- **API Routes (Express.js)**: Endpoints for bet slip management and OCR processing
- **OCR Processing Service**: Multi-provider integration with Google Vision and AWS Textract
- **Analytics Service**: Comprehensive betting performance metrics
- **Middleware**: Authentication and validation for security

### Feature Enhancements

- **Spanish Localization**: Complete Spanish translations for all betting-related text
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualization of betting performance metrics
- **Bet History View**: Detailed view of past bets with filtering and infinite scrolling
- **Push Notifications**: Notifications for bet settlements and other events
- **OCR Testing Utilities**: Tools for testing OCR accuracy and performance

For detailed information, see [Betting Slip Feature Summary](betting-slip-feature-summary.md) and [Backend Implementation Summary](backend-implementation-summary.md).

## React Components Library

The AI Sports Edge app uses a comprehensive library of React Native components built following atomic design principles. These components provide a consistent, accessible, and mobile-optimized experience across all screens.

### Custom Hooks

- **Mobile-Specific Hooks**: Haptics, camera, offline storage, form management
- **Cross-Platform Utilities**: Responsive design, theme integration, accessibility

### Atomic Components

- **Mobile-Optimized Atoms**: Buttons, inputs, cards with neon effects
- **Mobile-Optimized Molecules**: Form fields, action bars, tab bars, alerts
- **Mobile-Optimized Organisms**: Camera capture, quick bet entry, analytics charts

For detailed information, see [React Components Library Summary](react-components-library-summary.md).

## Setup and Deployment

### Environment Setup

- **Database Configuration**: PostgreSQL setup with Prisma migrations
- **API Integrations**: Google Cloud Vision API and AWS Textract setup
- **Security Configuration**: CORS, rate limiting, and security headers

### Deployment Process

- **Build Process**: Automated build process with environment-specific configurations
- **SFTP Deployment**: Deployment to GoDaddy hosting via SFTP
- **Firebase Integration**: Firebase authentication and Firestore database setup
