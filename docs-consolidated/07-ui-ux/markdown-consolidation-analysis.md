### 6.2 Content to Remain Separate

```diff
# Keep as separate specialized documents:

+ firebase-github-actions-setup.md
  - Detailed step-by-step instructions for GitHub Actions setup
  - Specific troubleshooting for GitHub Actions

+ firebase-custom-domain-setup.md
  - Detailed DNS configuration instructions
  - Domain verification steps
  - HTTPS setup specifics

+ component-dependency-graph.md
  - Visual ASCII diagrams that work better in a dedicated document
  - Detailed component relationship visualizations
```

## 7. Recommendation

Based on the analysis, I recommend a **hybrid approach**:

1. **Create a comprehensive master document** that follows the proposed structure in section 5.1. This document would serve as the main entry point for project documentation, containing all essential information in a logical, well-organized structure.

2. **Keep specialized documents separate** for specific detailed instructions:
   - `firebase-github-actions-setup.md` - For detailed GitHub Actions configuration
   - `firebase-custom-domain-setup.md` - For detailed DNS and domain setup
   - `component-dependency-graph.md` - For visual component relationships

3. **Consolidate overlapping documents**:
   - Merge `project-structure-analysis.md`, `project-analysis-summary.md`, and parts of `project-cleanup-guide.md` into the comprehensive document
   - Merge `project-cleanup-plan.md` and cleanup sections of `project-cleanup-guide.md` into the comprehensive document
   - Merge high-level Firebase information from all Firebase-related documents into the comprehensive document

### 7.1 Rationale

This hybrid approach offers several advantages:

1. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminates the significant content overlap (60-90% in some sections)
2. **Improved Navigation**: Provides a single entry point for most documentation needs
3. **Preserved Detail**: Maintains specialized documents for detailed procedures
4. **Logical Organization**: Groups related information by feature/category
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Reduces the number of files that need to be updated when information changes

### 7.2 Implementation Approach

To implement this recommendation:

1. Create the comprehensive document first
2. Update the specialized documents to reference the comprehensive document for shared information
3. Add cross-references in the comprehensive document to the specialized documents for detailed procedures
4. Update any existing references to the consolidated documents

## 8. Conclusion

The current documentation structure contains significant overlap across multiple files, with some sections having up to 90% similarity. While each document contains unique information, much of the content could be consolidated into a more maintainable structure.

The proposed hybrid approach would significantly reduce duplication while preserving all unique information and maintaining the benefits of specialized documents for detailed procedures. This would improve the overall documentation experience for developers working on the AI Sports Edge project.
