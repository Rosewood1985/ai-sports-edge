```

### Manual Generation

To manually generate the executive brief:

1. Double-click `generate-executive-brief.command` in the project root directory

3. The brief will be saved to the location specified above

### Setting Up Scheduling

To set up or update the scheduling:

1. Double-click `setup-executive-brief-cron.command` in the project root directory
2. The script will set up a cron job (Linux/Unix) or launchd agent (macOS)
3. The brief will be automatically generated daily at 8:00 AM

## Data Sources

The executive brief pulls data from the following sources:

1. **Daily Metrics**: `/data/daily-metrics.json`
2. **Sprint Information**: Current kickoff file in `/kickoffs/`
3. **Task Board**: `/task-board.md`

If these files don't exist or are incomplete, the script will use placeholder values.

## Logs

Logs for the executive brief system are stored in:

1. **Generation Log**: `/logs/executive-brief.log`
2. **Cron Setup Log**: `/status/cron-setup.log`

## Troubleshooting

If the executive brief is not being generated:

1. Check the log files for errors
2. Verify that the cron job or launchd agent is set up correctly
3. Ensure the data source files exist and are accessible
4. Run the generation script manually to see if there are any errors
