# Complete RSS Feed Integration Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the RSS feed integration for the AI Sports Edge app, including both the core implementation and the geolocation enhancement.

## Core Implementation (Completed)

The core RSS feed integration has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### Backend Components

1. **Content Filtering Module** (`api/rssFeeds/contentFiltering.js`)
   - Keyword-based filtering for sports categories
   - Betting content identification
   - Relevance scoring algorithm
   - Team-specific filtering

2. **RSS Feed Service** (`api/rssFeeds/fetchRssFeeds.js`)
   - Fetches RSS feeds from multiple sources
   - Parses XML to JSON
   - Caches results to reduce API calls
   - Applies content filtering based on user preferences

3. **API Endpoints** (`api/rssFeeds/index.js`)
   - GET endpoint for retrieving RSS feeds
   - POST endpoint for retrieving feeds with user preferences
   - POST endpoint for tracking news item clicks

4. **Cron Job** (`jobs/rssFeedCronJob.js`)
   - Periodically fetches and caches RSS feeds
   - Runs every 15 minutes
   - Ensures fresh content is always available

### Frontend Components

1. **News Ticker Component** (`web/components/NewsTicker.js`)
   - Displays scrolling news headlines
   - Auto-scrolls with configurable speed
   - Pauses on hover
   - Highlights betting-related content
   - Tracks clicks for analytics

2. **User Preferences Component** (`web/components/UserPreferences.js`)
   - Allows users to select preferred sports categories
   - Provides option to show only betting-related content
   - Enables users to add favorite teams
   - Allows setting maximum number of news items

3. **CSS Styles**
   - News ticker styles (`web/styles/news-ticker.css`)
   - User preferences styles (`web/styles/user-preferences.css`)

### Server Integration

1. **Server Configuration** (`server.js`)
   - Registers RSS feed API endpoints
   - Starts the RSS feed cron job

2. **Dependencies**
   - Added xml2js for XML parsing
   - Uses axios for HTTP requests
   - Employs node-cron for scheduling

## Geolocation Enhancement (Planned)

The geolocation enhancement will build upon the core implementation to provide localized content and odds suggestions:

### New Components

1. **Geolocation Service** (`services/geolocationService.js`)
   - Integrates with IPgeolocation.io API
   - Determines user location based on IP address
   - Identifies local teams based on location
   - Provides localized odds suggestions

2. **Enhanced Content Filtering**
   - Updates relevance scoring to prioritize local team news
   - Boosts scores for content related to local teams

3. **Updated User Preferences**
   - Adds location settings to preferences
   - Displays identified local teams
   - Provides opt-out mechanism for privacy

4. **Enhanced News Ticker**
   - Displays localized odds suggestions
   - Highlights local team news

### Technical Requirements

1. IPgeolocation.io API key
2. Secure storage for location data
3. Privacy controls and compliance measures
