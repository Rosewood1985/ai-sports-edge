# Push Notification System Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the push notification system for AI Sports Edge, including server-side notification sending, rich notifications with images, and notification templates for different event types.

## Architecture Overview

The push notification system consists of the following components:

1. **Client-Side Components**
   - `notificationService.ts`: Core service for managing push notifications
   - `NotificationPermissionManager.tsx`: Component for handling notification permissions
   - `RichNotification.tsx`: Component for displaying rich notifications with images
   - `NotificationManager.tsx`: Component for managing and displaying in-app notifications

2. **Server-Side Components**
   - `notificationSender.js`: Firebase Cloud Function for sending notifications
   - Notification templates for different event types
   - Scheduled functions for automated notifications

3. **Integration Points**
   - Deep linking integration for notification actions
   - Analytics tracking for notification events
   - User preference management for notification settings

## Client-Side Implementation

### Notification Service (`notificationService.ts`)

The notification service handles the core functionality of push notifications on the client side:

- **Permission Management**: Requesting and checking notification permissions
- **Token Management**: Registering and storing push tokens
- **Local Notifications**: Scheduling and managing local notifications
- **Preference Management**: Storing and retrieving user notification preferences
- **Quiet Hours**: Implementing quiet hours functionality to avoid disturbing users

### Notification Permission Manager (`NotificationPermissionManager.tsx`)

This component provides a user-friendly interface for requesting notification permissions:

- **Permission Prompts**: Displaying permission prompts at appropriate times
- **Permission Reminders**: Showing reminders if permission is denied
- **Settings Navigation**: Guiding users to device settings if needed
- **Permission Status**: Tracking and displaying permission status

### Rich Notification Component (`RichNotification.tsx`)

This component displays rich notifications with images in the app:

- **Visual Design**: Attractive notification design with icons and images
- **Animation**: Smooth entrance and exit animations
- **Interaction**: Handling notification taps and dismissals
- **Category Styling**: Different styles for different notification categories

### Notification Manager (`NotificationManager.tsx`)

This component manages and displays in-app notifications:

- **Notification Queue**: Managing multiple notifications
- **Notification History**: Storing notification history
- **Foreground Handling**: Showing notifications when app is in foreground
- **Deep Link Handling**: Processing deep links in notifications
- **Context Provider**: Providing notification functionality to the app

## Server-Side Implementation

### Notification Sender (`notificationSender.js`)

This Firebase Cloud Function handles sending push notifications:

- **Template Processing**: Processing notification templates with data
- **User Targeting**: Sending notifications to specific users or groups
- **Preference Checking**: Respecting user notification preferences
- **Quiet Hours**: Respecting quiet hours settings
- **Logging**: Logging notifications for analytics and debugging

### Notification Templates

The system includes templates for different notification types:

- **Game Start**: Notifications for games about to begin
- **Game End**: Notifications for game results
- **Bet Opportunity**: Notifications for betting opportunities
- **Bet Result**: Notifications for bet outcomes
- **Player Update**: Notifications for player news and updates
- **Team Update**: Notifications for team news and updates
- **Subscription**: Notifications for subscription-related events
- **Referral**: Notifications for referral program events
- **System**: General system notifications

### Automated Notification Functions

The system includes scheduled functions for automated notifications:

- **Game Start Notifications**: Scheduled function to send notifications for games starting soon
- **Bet Result Notifications**: Triggered function to send notifications when bets are settled
- **Other Event-Based Notifications**: Various functions triggered by database events

## Rich Notifications with Images

The system supports rich notifications with images:

- **Image Support**: Adding images to notifications for better engagement
- **Image Fallback**: Handling cases where images fail to load
- **Image Optimization**: Optimizing images for different devices and network conditions
- **Image Caching**: Caching images for better performance

## Integration with Other Systems

### Deep Linking Integration

Notifications are integrated with the deep linking system:

- **Deep Link Generation**: Generating deep links for notifications
- **Deep Link Handling**: Processing deep links when notifications are tapped
- **Navigation**: Navigating to the appropriate screen based on the deep link

### Analytics Integration

Notification events are tracked for analytics:

- **Notification Sent**: Tracking when notifications are sent
- **Notification Received**: Tracking when notifications are received
- **Notification Opened**: Tracking when notifications are opened
- **Notification Dismissed**: Tracking when notifications are dismissed

### User Preference Integration

Notifications respect user preferences:

- **Category Preferences**: Allowing users to enable/disable specific notification categories
- **Quiet Hours**: Allowing users to set quiet hours when notifications are suppressed
- **Frequency Control**: Limiting notification frequency to avoid overwhelming users

## Testing and Validation

The notification system has been tested in various scenarios:

- **Permission Scenarios**: Testing different permission states
- **Network Conditions**: Testing under different network conditions
- **Device States**: Testing with app in foreground, background, and closed
- **Platform Differences**: Testing on iOS and Android platforms
- **User Preferences**: Testing with different user preference settings

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the notification system:

- **A/B Testing**: Testing different notification content and timing
- **Machine Learning**: Using ML to optimize notification timing and content
- **Personalization**: Further personalizing notifications based on user behavior
- **Interactive Notifications**: Adding interactive elements to notifications
- **Notification Analytics**: More detailed analytics for notification performance

## Conclusion

The push notification system provides a robust and flexible way to engage users with timely and relevant information. The implementation follows best practices for push notifications, including respecting user preferences, providing rich content, and integrating with other systems for a seamless user experience.
