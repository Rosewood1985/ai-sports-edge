```

### 1. User Document Denormalization

- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Implementation Time**: 3-5 days

```typescript
// Before: Multiple reads
const getUserData = async (userId) => {
  const userDoc = await firestore.collection("users").doc(userId).get();
  const prefsDoc = await firestore
    .collection("userPreferences")
    .doc(userId)
    .get();
  const streaksDoc = await firestore
    .collection("userStreaks")
    .doc(userId)
    .get();

  return {
    user: userDoc.data(),
    preferences: prefsDoc.data(),
    streaks: streaksDoc.data(),
  };
};

// After: Single read
const getUserData = async (userId) => {
  const userDoc = await firestore.collection("users").doc(userId).get();
  return userDoc.data(); // Contains embedded preferences and streaks
};
```

### 2. Basic Caching Layer

- **Impact**: High (reduces repeated reads)
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Implementation Time**: 3-5 days

```typescript
// Simple caching service
class CacheService {
  async get(key, ttl = 5 * 60 * 1000) {
    try {
      const cached = await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);
      if (!cached) return null;

      const { data, timestamp } = JSON.parse(cached);
      if (Date.now() - timestamp > ttl) {
        await AsyncStorage.removeItem(key);
        return null;
      }

      return data;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Cache read error:", error);
      return null;
    }
  }

  async set(key, data) {
    try {
      await AsyncStorage.setItem(
        key,
        JSON.stringify({
          data,
          timestamp: Date.now(),
        })
      );
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Cache write error:", error);
    }
  }
}
```

## Risk Assessment

| Risk                                | Impact | Probability | Mitigation                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Data migration issues               | High   | Medium      | Implement gradual migration with fallbacks |
| Performance degradation             | High   | Low         | Benchmark each phase before release        |
| User confusion with new features    | Medium | Medium      | Provide clear onboarding for new features  |
| Firebase cost increases             | Medium | Low         | Monitor usage closely during rollout       |
| Cross-platform compatibility issues | Medium | Medium      | Test thoroughly on both web and iOS        |

## Success Metrics

For each phase, we'll track the following metrics:

1. **Firebase Operations**

   - Read operations per user session
   - Write operations per user session
   - Cost per active user

2. **Performance**

   - App startup time
   - Screen transition time
   - Data loading time

3. **User Engagement**
   - Session duration
   - Feature usage
   - Retention metrics

## Conclusion

This phased approach allows us to implement the most critical optimizations first, delivering value incrementally while managing complexity. By focusing on the foundation in Phase 1 and then building on it with high-impact features in Phase 2, we can achieve significant improvements early in the process.

The critical path optimizations provide the highest return on investment and should be prioritized. As we progress through the phases, we can adjust the plan based on feedback and metrics to ensure we're delivering the most value to users while optimizing Firebase usage.
