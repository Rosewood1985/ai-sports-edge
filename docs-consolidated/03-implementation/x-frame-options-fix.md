# X-Frame-Options Fix

**Date:** April 22, 2025
**Task:** Remove X-Frame-Options meta tag for iframe compatibility

## Problem

The website was using a meta tag to set X-Frame-Options to SAMEORIGIN:

```html
<meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options" content="SAMEORIGIN">
```

This was causing issues:
- Chrome DevTools warnings about X-Frame-Options
- Inability to embed the site in iframes on other domains
- Potential issues with affiliate sites trying to embed content
- Conflicts with embedding partners

## Solution

1. **Removed the X-Frame-Options meta tag**
   - Deleted the line `<meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options" content="SAMEORIGIN">` from index.html
   - Kept other security headers intact (CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

2. **Deployment**
   - Deployed the modified index.html file to the server using SFTP
   - No need to rebuild the entire app since this was a simple HTML change

## Benefits

- **Iframe Compatibility**: The site can now be embedded in iframes on other domains
- **No DevTools Warnings**: Chrome DevTools no longer shows warnings about X-Frame-Options
- **Affiliate Integration**: Affiliate sites can now embed the content directly
- **Partner Compatibility**: Embedding partners can integrate the site more easily

## Security Considerations

While removing X-Frame-Options might seem like a security downgrade, the site still has:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: The CSP header includes `frame-src` directives that control which domains can embed the site
2. **Other Security Headers**: X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Referrer-Policy are still in place
3. **Permissions Policy**: Restricts access to sensitive features like camera and microphone

## Implementation Notes

The X-Frame-Options header was originally added as a defense against clickjacking attacks. However, modern browsers support CSP which provides more granular control over framing policies. The site's CSP is configured to allow framing only from specific trusted domains, which provides adequate protection against clickjacking while allowing legitimate embedding.
