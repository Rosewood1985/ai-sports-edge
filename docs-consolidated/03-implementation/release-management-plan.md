# Release Management Plan

This document outlines the release management strategy for AI Sports Edge, including CI/CD pipeline, versioning strategy, rollback procedures, feature flags, and canary deployments.

## Overview

The release management plan consists of the following components:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipeline
2. **Versioning Strategy**: Semantic versioning with proper changelog management
3. **Rollback Procedures**: Procedures for safely rolling back to previous versions
4. **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout of features to users
5. **Canary Deployments**: Testing new versions with a subset of users

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process, ensuring consistent and reliable releases.

### Components

- **Source Control**: GitHub repository
- **Build System**: AWS CodeBuild
- **Artifact Storage**: Amazon ECR for Docker images, S3 for other artifacts
- **Deployment**: AWS CodeDeploy

### Workflow

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. CodeBuild builds and tests the application
3. If tests pass, artifacts are stored in ECR/S3
4. CodeDeploy deploys the application to the target environment

## Versioning Strategy

We follow semantic versioning (SemVer) to manage application versions.

### Format

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]`

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible functionality
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes
- **PRERELEASE**: Alpha, beta, or release candidate
- **BUILD**: Build metadata

### Changelog Management

All changes are documented in `CHANGELOG.md` following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.

### Commands

```bash
# Display current version
./infrastructure/release-management/versioning-strategy.sh --current

# Bump version
./infrastructure/release-management/versioning-strategy.sh --bump minor

# Create pre-release
./infrastructure/release-management/versioning-strategy.sh --prerelease beta
```

## Rollback Procedures

In case of issues with a new release, we have procedures to safely roll back to a previous version.

### Types of Rollbacks

- **Code Rollback**: Revert to a previous git commit
- **Database Rollback**: Restore from a database backup
- **Deployment Rollback**: Redeploy a previous container image

### Commands

```bash
# List available images
./infrastructure/release-management/rollback-procedure.sh --list-images

# Rollback to a specific image
./infrastructure/release-management/rollback-procedure.sh --rollback-image v1.2.3

# Complete rollback (code, database, deployment)
./infrastructure/release-management/rollback-procedure.sh --complete-rollback 1.2.3
```

## Feature Flags

Feature flags allow us to enable or disable features at runtime, enabling gradual rollout and A/B testing.

### Flag Structure

Each feature flag has the following properties:

- `enabled`: Boolean indicating if the flag is enabled
- `rolloutPercentage`: Percentage of users who should see the feature
- `targetUsers`: Specific users who should always see the feature
- `targetGroups`: User groups who should always see the feature

### Gradual Rollout Strategy

1. Add feature flag with `enabled: false` and `rolloutPercentage: 0`
2. Deploy code with feature hidden behind the flag
3. Enable for internal testing with `targetUsers` or `targetGroups`
4. Gradually increase `rolloutPercentage`: 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%
5. If issues occur, set `enabled: false` to disable the feature
6. Once stable at 100%, remove the flag in a future release

### Commands

```bash
# Initialize feature flags system
./infrastructure/release-management/feature-flags.sh --init

# Create a new feature flag
./infrastructure/release-management/feature-flags.sh --create-flag newFeature

# Enable a feature flag
./infrastructure/release-management/feature-flags.sh --enable newFeature

# Set rollout percentage
./infrastructure/release-management/feature-flags.sh --rollout newFeature 25
```

## Canary Deployments

Canary deployments allow us to test new versions with a subset of users before rolling out to everyone.

### Workflow

1. Deploy new version to a small subset of servers/users (e.g., 5-10%)
2. Monitor for issues (errors, performance degradation)
3. If no issues, gradually increase traffic to the new version
4. If issues occur, roll back to the previous version

### Metrics Monitored

- Error rate
- Latency
- CPU utilization
- Memory usage
- Custom application metrics

### Commands

```bash
# Initialize canary deployment system
./infrastructure/release-management/canary-deployments.sh --init

# Start canary deployment
./infrastructure/release-management/canary-deployments.sh --start v1.2.3 10

# Update canary traffic
./infrastructure/release-management/canary-deployments.sh --update-traffic 25

# Promote canary to production
./infrastructure/release-management/canary-deployments.sh --promote

# Check canary status
./infrastructure/release-management/canary-deployments.sh --status
```

## Integrated Release Management

The main release management script orchestrates all components for a streamlined release process.

### Commands

```bash
# Initialize all release management components
./infrastructure/release-management/release-management.sh --init

# Create a new release
./infrastructure/release-management/release-management.sh --create-release minor

# Deploy a release
./infrastructure/release-management/release-management.sh --deploy v1.2.3

# Deploy as canary
./infrastructure/release-management/release-management.sh --deploy v1.2.3 --canary 10

# Rollback to a previous version
./infrastructure/release-management/release-management.sh --rollback v1.1.0
```

## Release Checklist

Before each release, ensure the following steps are completed:

1. All tests pass (unit, integration, end-to-end)
2. Code has been reviewed and approved
3. Documentation is updated
4. Release notes are prepared
5. Database migrations are tested
6. Rollback procedures are verified
7. Monitoring and alerting are configured

## Post-Release Monitoring

After each release, monitor the following:

1. Error rates and exceptions
2. Performance metrics
3. User feedback
4. Business metrics
5. Infrastructure health

## Conclusion

This release management plan provides a comprehensive approach to managing releases for AI Sports Edge. By following these procedures, we can ensure reliable, consistent, and safe releases while minimizing downtime and user impact.
