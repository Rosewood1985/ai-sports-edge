# AI Sports Edge: Technical Debt Inventory

This document tracks technical debt items that need to be addressed in the AI Sports Edge application. Addressing these items will improve code quality, performance, and maintainability.

## Code Quality Issues

### Refactoring Needs

| Component/File | Issue | Priority | Estimated Effort |

| `services/bettingAnalyticsService.ts` | Complex methods need breaking down | High | 3 days |
| `components/BettingAnalytics.tsx` | Component is too large and has too many responsibilities | High | 4 days |
| `screens/BettingAnalyticsScreen.tsx` | Contains business logic that should be in services | Medium | 2 days |
| `utils/geoip/geoipService.ts` | Duplicate code with geolocationService | Low | 1 day |

### Testing Gaps

| Area | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Priority |
|------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| API Services | 45% | 80% | High |
| UI Components | 30% | 70% | Medium |
| Utility Functions | 60% | 90% | Medium |

| Tight coupling between components | Difficult to maintain and test | High |
| Lack of dependency injection | Hard to test, rigid dependencies | Medium |
| Inconsistent error handling | Unpredictable user experience | Medium |
| No clear separation of concerns | Code duplication, maintenance issues | High |

### API Integration Issues

| Issue | Impact | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Inconsistent API error handling | Poor error recovery | High |
| No API request caching strategy | Excessive network requests | Medium |
| Hardcoded API endpoints | Difficult to switch environments | Low |
| No API versioning strategy | Potential breaking changes | Medium |
| Incomplete API retry logic | Poor reliability on unstable connections | High |

## Dependencies and Libraries

### Outdated Dependencies

| Package | Current Version | Latest Version | Breaking Changes | Priority |
