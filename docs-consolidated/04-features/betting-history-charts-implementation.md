# Betting History Charts Implementation

## Overview

The Betting History Charts feature provides users with visual representations of their betting data, allowing them to identify trends, patterns, and insights that might not be apparent from raw numbers alone. This feature complements the Betting Analytics functionality by offering intuitive graphical displays of betting performance over time.

## Key Components

### 1. BettingHistoryChart Component

The core of this feature is the `BettingHistoryChart` component, which provides the following functionality:

- **Multiple Chart Types**: Displays different visualizations including profit history, win rate history, bet type distribution, and sport distribution
- **Time Period Filtering**: Allows filtering data by week, month, year, or all time
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Interactive Elements**: Provides context and details through tooltips and legends

### 2. User Interface Components

- **BettingHistoryScreen**: Dedicated screen for the charts feature with filtering options
- **Settings Integration**: Access to the feature through the app's settings menu
- **Period Selector**: UI for selecting different time periods
- **Chart Type Selector**: UI for switching between different chart types

## Technical Implementation

### Chart Types

The feature implements four main chart types:

1. **Profit History (Line Chart)**:
   - Shows cumulative profit over time
   - Helps users visualize their overall betting performance trajectory
   - Color-coded based on positive or negative profit

2. **Win Rate History (Line Chart)**:
   - Displays win percentage over time
   - Helps users identify periods of better or worse performance
   - Useful for spotting trends in betting success

3. **Bet Type Distribution (Pie Chart)**:
   - Shows the proportion of different bet types (moneyline, spread, over/under, etc.)
   - Helps users understand their betting preferences
   - Useful for identifying which bet types are most frequently used

4. **Sport Distribution (Pie Chart)**:
   - Visualizes the breakdown of bets by sport
   - Helps users understand their sport preferences
   - Useful for identifying which sports are most frequently bet on

### Data Processing

The component performs several data processing operations:

1. **Time-Based Grouping**: Groups bets by day, week, or month depending on the selected time period
2. **Cumulative Calculations**: Computes running totals for metrics like profit
3. **Percentage Calculations**: Derives proportions for pie charts
4. **Formatting**: Converts raw data into chart-friendly formats

### Chart Library Integration

The feature uses the `react-native-chart-kit` library, which provides:

- Line charts for time-series data
- Pie charts for distribution data
- Customizable styling and configuration
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Integration Points

The betting history charts feature integrates with several existing systems:

1. **Betting Analytics Service**: Uses the same underlying data and service
2. **Navigation System**: Added to the app's navigation stack
3. **Settings Menu**: Accessible through the Analytics section in settings
4. **Theming System**: Leverages ThemedView and ThemedText for consistent styling

## User Experience Considerations

Several UX considerations were implemented:

1. **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators while data is being fetched
2. **Empty States**: Displays appropriate messages when no data is available
3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles and displays errors
4. **Scrollable Charts**: Allows horizontal scrolling for charts with many data points
5. **Consistent Color Scheme**: Uses a coherent color palette across all charts

## Performance Optimizations

To ensure smooth performance, the feature implements:

1. **Data Caching**: Reuses fetched data when possible
2. **Efficient Rendering**: Minimizes unnecessary re-renders
3. **Lazy Loading**: Loads chart data only when needed
4. **Pagination**: Limits the amount of data displayed at once

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the betting history charts feature include:

1. **Interactive Charts**: Allow users to tap on chart elements for more details
2. **Export Functionality**: Enable exporting charts as images or PDFs
3. **Additional Chart Types**: Implement more visualization options like heat maps or bubble charts
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Add ability to compare performance across different time periods
5. **Custom Date Ranges**: Allow users to select specific date ranges for analysis

- react-native-chart-kit
- Firebase Firestore (for data storage)
- React Navigation (for screen navigation)
