## Performance Optimizations

### Memoization

Implemented memoization in visualization components to prevent unnecessary recalculations and re-renders:

- **HeatMapChart**: Memoized data formatting, color conversion, chart configuration, and end date calculation
- **BubbleChart**: Memoized min/max value calculations, bubble size calculations, position calculations, and bubble data preparation
- **HistoricalTrendsChart**: Memoized color conversion, chart data preparation, and chart configuration

### Lazy Loading

Implemented lazy loading for visualization components to reduce initial bundle size and improve load times:

```typescript
// Enhanced Analytics Components - Lazy loaded for performance
export const HeatMapChart = React.lazy(() => import('../HeatMapChart'));
export const BubbleChart = React.lazy(() => import('../BubbleChart'));
export const HistoricalTrendsChart = React.lazy(() => import('../HistoricalTrendsChart'));
```

Added Suspense with loading fallbacks in `EnhancedAnalyticsDashboardScreen`:

```typescript
<Suspense fallback={<ChartLoadingFallback />}>
  <HeatMapChart
    data={betting_performance.heat_map_data}
    title="Betting Activity Heatmap"
    chartColor={Colors.neon.purple}
  />
</Suspense>
```

### Error Handling with Caching

Enhanced the `analyticsService` with caching to improve reliability and performance:

- Data is cached after successful API calls
- Cached data is returned when API calls fail
- Cache expiration is implemented to ensure data freshness

## Internationalization

### URL Structure and Language Detection

#### Web Platform

Implemented language-specific URL structure for the web application:

```
https://ai-sports-edge.com/en/dashboard  # English version
https://ai-sports-edge.com/es/dashboard  # Spanish version
```

Created a `LanguageRedirect` component that:
- Extracts the language from the URL path
- Sets the application language based on the URL
- Redirects to a language-specific URL based on the device locale if no language is specified

#### iOS Platform

Implemented automatic language detection for the iOS application:

- Created a `LanguageChangeListener` component that listens for device locale changes
- Added a native `LocaleManager` module that bridges between iOS and React Native
- Implemented automatic language switching when the device language changes

### Translation System

Created a comprehensive translation system:

- Implemented an `I18nContext` that provides translation functions and localized formatting
- Created translation files for English and Spanish
- Added support for interpolation in translations
- Implemented localized formatting for numbers, dates, and currencies

### SEO Optimization

Added SEO optimization for multilingual content:

- Implemented a `SEOMetadata` component that adds appropriate metadata for SEO
- Added hreflang tags for language alternatives
- Created a multilingual XML sitemap generator
- Integrated sitemap generation into the build process

## Accessibility Features

### ARIA Attributes

Added ARIA attributes to make charts accessible to screen readers:

```tsx
<View 
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityLabel={title}
  accessibilityHint={t('charts.heatmap.accessibilityHint')}
>
  {/* Chart content */}
</View>
```

### Keyboard Navigation

Implemented keyboard navigation for chart components:

```tsx
const handleKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent) => {
  switch (e.key) {
    case 'ArrowRight':
      setFocusedDay(prev => (prev !== null && prev < numDays - 1) ? prev + 1 : prev);
      break;
    case 'ArrowLeft':
      setFocusedDay(prev => (prev !== null && prev > 0) ? prev - 1 : prev);
      break;
    // ... more key handlers
  }
};
```

### Screen Reader Support

Enhanced screen reader support with accessible summaries:

```tsx
const accessibleSummary = useMemo(() => {
  const totalActivities = Object.values(data).reduce((sum, count) => sum + count, 0);
  const activeDays = Object.values(data).filter(count => count > 0).length;
  const mostActiveDate = Object.entries(data).sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])[0];
  
  return t('charts.heatmap.accessibleSummary', {
    totalActivities,
    activeDays,
    totalDays: numDays,
    mostActiveDate: mostActiveDate ? `${mostActiveDate[0]} with ${mostActiveDate[1]} activities` : 'None'
  });
}, [data, numDays, t]);
```

### Internationalized Accessibility

Connected accessibility features with the internationalization system:

- Translated all accessibility labels and hints
- Added accessibility-specific translations to language files
- Ensured consistent experience across languages

## UI/UX Improvements

### Consistent Design Language

Implemented a consistent design language across the dashboard:

- Used the same color scheme for all charts
- Applied consistent spacing and padding
- Used consistent typography for all text elements
- Implemented consistent loading states

### Responsive Design

Enhanced the responsive design of the dashboard:

- Used relative units for sizing
- Implemented responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Added proper handling of orientation changes
- Ensured touch targets are appropriately sized

## Future Recommendations

### Performance

1. **Virtualization for Lists**: Implement windowing for long lists to only render visible items
2. **Code Splitting**: Further split the application code into smaller chunks
3. **Web Worker Offloading**: Move heavy computations to web workers for web platforms
4. **Optimistic UI Updates**: Update the UI immediately before API calls complete
5. **Incremental Loading**: Load data in chunks as the user scrolls

### Accessibility

1. **More Robust Focus Management**: Implement more sophisticated focus management
2. **More Detailed Chart Descriptions**: Add more detailed descriptions for complex charts
3. **Support for More Assistive Technologies**: Add support for additional assistive technologies
4. **Animation Controls**: Improve controls for users with vestibular disorders

### Internationalization

1. **Support for More Languages**: Add support for additional languages
2. **Right-to-Left Support**: Add support for right-to-left languages
3. **Region-Specific Content**: Add support for region-specific content
4. **Locale-Specific Formatting**: Enhance locale-specific formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies
