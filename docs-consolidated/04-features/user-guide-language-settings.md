When you first launch the app, it will automatically detect your device's language settings:

- If your device is set to one of our supported languages (English or Spanish), the app will use that language.
- If your device is set to a language we don't currently support, the app will default to English.

## App Restart

Some language changes may require restarting the app to fully apply all translations. If you notice any untranslated text after changing languages, please close and reopen the app.

Some features in the app may have language-specific content:

- **News**: News articles may be available in specific languages

If you notice any incorrect or missing translations:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Help** > **Feedback**
2. Select "Report a translation issue"
3. Provide details about the incorrect translation
4. Submit your feedback

Our team regularly reviews translation feedback and makes improvements in app updates.
