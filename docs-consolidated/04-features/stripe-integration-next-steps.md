# Stripe Integration: Next Steps

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete the Stripe integration for the AI Sports Edge app. We've already made significant progress with the implementation of the subscription service and documentation, but there are still several key components that need to be addressed.

## Current Progress

So far, we have:

1. Created comprehensive documentation for the Stripe integration
2. Implemented the `subscriptionService.ts` with proper error handling
3. Created a `StripeProvider.tsx` component (needs package installation)
4. Created utility functions for error handling

## Next Steps

### 1. Package Installation

Before proceeding with the implementation, we need to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install @stripe/stripe-react-native
npm install @react-native-firebase/functions
```

The error in the StripeProvider component is due to the missing @stripe/stripe-react-native package.

### 2. Component Implementation

#### 2.1 Fix StripeProvider Component

The current StripeProvider component has an error because the @stripe/stripe-react-native package is not installed. After installing the package, the component should work correctly.

#### 2.2 Create Subscription Screens

Based on our documentation, we need to implement the following screens:

1. **SubscriptionScreen.tsx** - Display available subscription plans
2. **PaymentScreen.tsx** - Handle payment information collection
3. **SubscriptionManagementScreen.tsx** - Manage existing subscriptions
4. **RefundPolicyScreen.tsx** - Display cancellation and refund policy

#### 2.3 Create Premium Feature Component

Create a PremiumFeature component that will guard premium content and redirect users to the subscription screen if they don't have access:

```typescript
// components/PremiumFeature.tsx
```

### 3. Navigation Updates

Update the navigation to include the new subscription-related screens:

1. Add the screens to the RootStackParamList in AppNavigator.tsx
2. Add the screens to the Stack Navigator
3. Update the Settings screen to include a link to the subscription management screen

### 4. Firebase Functions Implementation

Implement the Firebase Cloud Functions that will handle the Stripe API interactions:

1. Set up a Firebase Functions project
2. Implement the functions defined in the firebase-functions-implementation.md document
3. Deploy the functions to Firebase

### 5. App Updates

Update the App.tsx file to include the StripeProvider and any other necessary providers:

```typescript
// App.tsx
import StripeProvider from './components/StripeProvider';
// ...

function App(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <StripeProvider>
      <AppNavigator />
    </StripeProvider>
  );
}
```

### 6. Testing

Test the complete subscription flow:

1. Test subscription creation with different card types
2. Test subscription management (viewing, canceling)
3. Test payment methods (adding, updating, removing)
4. Test one-time payments
5. Test premium access restrictions

### 7. Production Deployment

Prepare for production deployment:

1. Update environment variables for production
2. Set up Stripe webhooks for production
3. Implement proper error handling and monitoring
4. Test the complete flow in production

## Implementation Priority

1. Package installation
2. Firebase Functions implementation
3. Subscription screens implementation
4. Navigation updates
5. App updates
6. Testing
7. Production deployment
