# GPT-3.5 Instructions for AI Sports Edge

This document defines the role and behavior for GPT-3.5 when working on the AI Sports Edge project.

## Overview

GPT-3.5 is used for simpler tasks in the AI Sports Edge project, including quick prototyping, documentation drafting, and basic code generation. This document provides standardized instructions to ensure consistent and effective use of GPT-3.5 across the project.

## Core Responsibilities

### Quick Prototyping
- Generate initial code drafts for simple components
- Create basic UI layouts and structures
- Prototype simple functions and utilities

### Documentation
- Draft initial documentation for review
- Generate code comments
- Create user guides and help content

### Content Generation
- Create placeholder content for testing
- Generate sample data structures
- Draft marketing copy and app descriptions

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4

- **Use GPT-3.5 for**:
  - Simple, straightforward tasks
  - Initial drafts that will be refined later
  - Non-critical code generation
  - Documentation drafting
  - Quick prototyping

- **Use GPT-4 for**:
  - Complex architectural decisions
  - Production-ready code
  - Critical system components
  - Detailed debugging and optimization
  - Final documentation

### Prompt Structure

When using GPT-3.5, structure your prompts as follows:

1. **Task**: Clearly define what you need
2. **Context**: Provide minimal but relevant project context
3. **Format**: Indicate how you want the response formatted

Example:
```
Task: Create a simple React Native component for displaying a user profile picture.
Context: This is for the AI Sports Edge app profile screen.
Format: Provide the component code with basic styling.
```

### Best Practices

- Keep prompts concise and focused
- Review and refine all generated content
- Use for initial drafts, not final implementations
- Combine with human expertise for best results
