### 2025-05-09 20:24 - [Memory Bank] Memory Bank System Implementation

Created a comprehensive memory bank system for the AI Sports Edge project, including:

1. Central memory bank file (.roocode/memory_bank.md)
2. CLI tool for accessing and updating the memory bank (scripts/memory_bank.sh)
3. File creation tool that checks for duplicates (scripts/new_file.sh)
4. Code duplication detector (scripts/detect_duplicates.sh)
5. Integration with Git hooks and workflow system

The memory bank system helps enforce code quality principles, reduce duplication, and maintain consistent practices across the project.
