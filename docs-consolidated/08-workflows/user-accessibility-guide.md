### Screen Reader Hints

The "Screen Reader Hints" option in Accessibility Settings provides additional context for screen reader users. When enabled, elements will include more detailed descriptions to help you understand their purpose and functionality.

## Navigation and Controls

### Touch Target Size

All interactive elements in AI Sports Edge are designed with adequately sized touch targets (at least 44x44 points) to ensure they're easy to tap accurately.

### Focus Indicators

When using a keyboard or switch control, focus indicators clearly show which element is currently selected.

### Consistent Navigation

Navigation patterns are consistent throughout the app, with the main tabs always available at the bottom of the screen and back buttons in the top-left corner.

## Color and Contrast

### High Contrast Mode

The "High Contrast" option in Accessibility Settings increases the contrast between text, controls, and backgrounds for better visibility.

### Color Independence

All information in AI Sports Edge is conveyed through means other than color alone. Icons, labels, and other indicators ensure that color-blind users can navigate and use the app effectively.

### Contrast Ratios

Text and interactive elements meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components).

## Motion and Animation

### Reduce Motion

The "Reduce Motion" option in Accessibility Settings minimizes or eliminates animations and motion effects throughout the app. This is particularly helpful for users who experience motion sensitivity or vestibular disorders.

### Auto-Playing Content

AI Sports Edge does not include auto-playing videos or animations that cannot be paused or stopped.

## Keyboard and External Device Support

### Keyboard Navigation

AI Sports Edge supports full keyboard navigation on web and when using an external keyboard with mobile devices.
