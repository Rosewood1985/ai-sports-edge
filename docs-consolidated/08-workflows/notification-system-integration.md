# ðŸ“§ AI Sports Edge â€” Notification System Integration

This document describes the integration between the Executive Brief system and the email notification system for AI Sports Edge.

## Overview

The integration combines the Executive Brief with other daily information to create a comprehensive daily brief that is sent via email. This ensures that key metrics, priorities, and action items are delivered to stakeholders every morning.

## Components

1. **Executive Brief System**: Generates a standardized daily executive summary
2. **Daily Brief Generator**: Combines the Executive Brief with other system information
3. **Email Notification System**: Sends the combined brief via email
4. **Scheduling System**: Automates the generation and delivery process
5. **Testing Tools**: Allows for manual testing of the system

## File Structure

```
/notification-system/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ generate-daily-brief.sh     # Combines Executive Brief with other info
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ send-daily-brief.sh         # Sends the combined brief via email
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ send-gmail-secure.sh        # Handles secure email delivery
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ setup-unified-schedule.sh   # Sets up the unified cron schedule
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ daily-brief-YYYY-MM-DD.md   # Generated daily briefs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ action-items.md             # Current action items
â””â”€â”€ test-daily-email.command        # Test command for manual testing
```

## Process Flow

1. **Executive Brief Generation** (6:50 AM):
   - The Executive Brief is generated using `/scripts/generate-executive-brief.sh`
   - The brief is saved to `/docs-consolidated/05-business/FOUNDER_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF.md`

2. **Daily Brief Generation** (7:00 AM):
   - The Daily Brief is generated using `/notification-system/scripts/generate-daily-brief.sh`
   - This script includes the Executive Brief and adds:
     - System status overview
     - Cron job results
     - Error monitoring
     - Today's schedule
     - Documentation health
     - GPT system status
     - Pending reviews
     - Quick actions needed
   - The combined brief is saved to `/notification-system/reports/daily-brief-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

3. **Email Delivery** (7:00 AM):
   - The Daily Brief is sent via email using `/notification-system/scripts/send-daily-brief.sh`
   - The email is sent to `ai.sportsedgeapp@gmail.com`

## Scheduling

The system is scheduled to run automatically using cron:

```
# Executive Brief Generation - 6:50 AM (before email send)
50 6 * * * /Users/lisadario/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/scripts/generate-executive-brief.sh >> /Users/lisadario/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/logs/executive-brief.log 2>&1 # executive-brief-gen

# Daily Brief with Executive Brief - 7:00 AM

2. **Daily Email Log**: `/logs/daily-email.log`
3. **Email Notifications Log**: `/logs/email-notifications.log`

## Customization

To customize the daily brief:

3. Run the test command to verify your changes

To change the scheduling:

1. Edit the cron times in `/notification-system/scripts/setup-unified-schedule.sh`

## Troubleshooting

If the daily brief is not being generated or sent:

1. Check the log files for errors
