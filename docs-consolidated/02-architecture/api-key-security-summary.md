# API Key Security Improvements

## Overview

This update implements a comprehensive API key security system to address several critical issues:

1. Hardcoded API keys in source code
2. Inconsistent error handling for missing keys
3. Lack of validation for required environment variables
4. No centralized management of API credentials

## Changes Made

### 1. Centralized API Key Management

Created `utils/apiKeys.ts` to:
- Provide a single source of truth for all API keys
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Ensure type safety and clear service identification
- Prevent hardcoded keys throughout the codebase

### 2. Service Updates

Updated the following services to use the centralized system:

| Service | File | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| Weather API | `weatherService.ts` | Removed hardcoded key |
| Odds API | `OddsService.js` | Removed placeholder key |
| FanDuel | `FanDuelService.js` | Removed affiliate ID and API key placeholders |
| Stripe | `paymentService.js` | Removed secret key placeholder |
| Stripe Tax | `stripeTaxService.ts` | Fixed empty API key and updated API version |
| ML Data Fetch | `fetch-enhanced.js` | Removed hardcoded Odds API key |

### 3. Environment Validation

Added `utils/envCheck.js` to:
- Validate required environment variables at startup
- Group variables by category for easier troubleshooting
- Provide clear error messages for missing variables
- Allow configuration for exit on error or continue with warnings

### 4. App Initialization

Updated `App.tsx` to:
- Import and use the environment validation
- Log validation results with proper error handling
- Ensure validation happens early in the startup process

### 5. Documentation

- Created `.env.example` with all required variables and documentation
- Added comprehensive `docs/api-key-management.md` guide
- Created deployment script `deploy-api-key-security.sh`

## Security Benefits

- **Reduced Risk**: No more API keys in source code
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear messages when keys are missing
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Consistent pattern for accessing keys
- **Early Detection**: Validation at startup prevents runtime errors
- **Documentation**: Clear guidance for new developers

## Deployment

Use the provided deployment script:

```bash
./deploy-api-key-security.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check for a valid `.env` file
2. Build the application
3. Validate environment variables
4. Deploy to Firebase
5. Deploy Firebase Functions

## Next Steps

1. Audit any remaining services for hardcoded credentials
2. Implement key rotation procedures
3. Consider adding a secrets management service for production
4. Add monitoring for API key usage and rate limits
