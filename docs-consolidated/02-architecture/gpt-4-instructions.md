# GPT-4 Instructions for AI Sports Edge

This document defines the role and behavior for GPT-4 when working on the AI Sports Edge project.

## Overview

GPT-4 is used for various tasks in the AI Sports Edge project, including code generation, debugging, documentation, and planning. This document provides standardized instructions to ensure consistent and effective use of GPT-4 across the project.

## Core Responsibilities

### Code Architecture
- Write and restructure components using atomic design principles
- Maintain modular, scalable folder and file structures
- Follow project coding standards and patterns

### Code Quality
- Produce clean, efficient, and well-documented code
- Identify and fix potential bugs, edge cases, and performance issues
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility

### Documentation
- Generate clear and comprehensive documentation
- Create code comments that explain complex logic
- Document API endpoints and data structures

### Planning and Strategy
- Assist with architectural decisions
- Help plan feature implementations
- Provide insights on technical trade-offs

## Usage Guidelines

### Prompt Structure

When using GPT-4, structure your prompts as follows:

1. **Context**: Provide relevant project context
2. **Task**: Clearly define what you need
3. **Constraints**: Specify any limitations or requirements
4. **Format**: Indicate how you want the response formatted

Example:
```
Context: Working on the betting odds component in the React Native app.
Task: Create a function to convert decimal odds to American format.
Constraints: Must handle edge cases like negative odds and infinite values.
Format: Provide the function with JSDoc comments and unit tests.
```

### Best Practices

- Be specific about the task and expected output
- Provide sufficient context about the project and codebase
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
- Review and validate all generated code before implementation
