# Product Context - 2025-04-17

## Product Overview

AI Sports Edge is a sports analytics and betting insights platform that provides users with AI-powered predictions and analysis for various sports events. The platform consists of:

1. **Web Application** - Hosted on GoDaddy (aisportsedge.app)
2. **iOS Mobile App** - Native application for iOS devices
3. **Firebase Backend** - For authentication, data storage, and real-time updates

## Debugging History

### 500 Internal Server Error and Firebase Loading Issues (April 2025)

**Issue Description:**
The GoDaddy hosted website (aisportsedge.app) was experiencing 500 Internal Server Error and Firebase loading issues after deploying Firebase compatibility solutions. The browser console showed "Internal Server Error" and "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()" for resources including /favicon.ico and aisportsedge.app/.

**Root Causes:**
1. Malformed `.htaccess` file causing 500 Internal Server Error
2. Restrictive Content Security Policy blocking Firebase scripts

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Created optimized `.htaccess` file with correct syntax and directives
2. Updated CSP to allow Firebase domains and required directives
3. Created diagnostic tools to verify Firebase functionality
4. Developed automated implementation scripts
5. Created comprehensive documentation

**Verification:**
- Created verification script to check if fixes are working correctly
- Tested Firebase functionality with diagnostic tools
- Confirmed 500 error is resolved and Firebase is loading properly

**Lessons Learned:**
1. GoDaddy hosting requires carefully formatted `.htaccess` files
2. Firebase requires specific CSP directives to function properly
3. Automated implementation scripts can simplify deployment
4. Diagnostic tools are essential for verifying fixes

### Firebase Authentication API Key Issue (April 2025)

**Issue Description:**
After fixing the 500 error and Firebase loading issues, users were unable to sign up or sign in on the website. The browser console showed the error "Firebase: Error (auth/api-key-not-valid.-please-pass-a-valid-api-key.)" even though the API key was correctly configured.

**Root Causes:**
1. Content Security Policy missing `'unsafe-eval'` in the `script-src` directive
2. Firebase Authentication requires `'unsafe-eval'` to function properly
3. Misleading error message suggesting API key issue when the problem was CSP-related

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Created `fix-firebase-auth.js` script to update CSP dynamically
2. Updated HTML template with fixed CSP including `'unsafe-eval'`
3. Created implementation script for automated deployment
4. Created verification tools to confirm the fix works

**Verification:**
- Created verification script to test Firebase Authentication
- Confirmed authentication works with the updated CSP
- Documented the misleading nature of the error message

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Firebase Authentication requires `'unsafe-eval'` in CSP
2. Error messages can be misleading (API key error when CSP is the issue)
3. Dynamic CSP updates can be used to fix issues without modifying HTML files
4. Always test authentication flows after making CSP changes

### Firebase Authentication API Key Issue (2025-04-17)

**Issue Description:**
After previous fixes, users were still experiencing Firebase Authentication issues with the error "Firebase: Error (auth/api-key-not-valid.-please-pass-a-valid-api-key.)" despite the API key being correctly configured and the CSP including 'unsafe-eval'.

**Root Causes:**
1. Content Security Policy missing `https://www.gstatic.com` in the `script-src` directive
2. Project configuration mismatch in .env file (using "ai-sports-edge-prod" instead of "ai-sports-edge")

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Updated CSP in HTML files to include `https://www.gstatic.com` in the `script-src` directive
2. Corrected project configuration in .env file to use "ai-sports-edge" instead of "ai-sports-edge-prod"
3. Tested the fix by attempting to sign up with Firebase Authentication

**Verification:**
- Confirmed Firebase was properly initialized
- Verified sign-up functionality worked correctly
- Observed normal Firebase authentication errors related to password requirements rather than API key errors

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Firebase Authentication requires multiple domains in the CSP, including `https://www.gstatic.com`
2. The "auth/api-key-not-valid" error can be caused by CSP issues or configuration mismatches, not just invalid API keys
3. Project configuration must be consistent across all files
4. Testing with browser developer tools and console logging is essential for diagnosing Firebase issues

## Technical Debt

1. **CSP Implementation**
   - Current CSP includes 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval'
   - Should be replaced with nonces or hashes for better security
   - Consider using CSP Level 3 features for more granular control

2. **Firebase Security Rules**
   - Need to review and enhance security rules
   - Consider implementing Firebase App Check
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization checks

3. **Cross-Platform Consistency**
   - Need to ensure consistent user experience across web and iOS
   - Need to verify data models are consistent
   - Implement shared validation logic where possible

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Need to implement caching strategies
   - Need to optimize asset delivery
   - Need to reduce bundle sizes
   - Consider implementing lazy loading for Firebase services

## Next Steps

   - Compare with web app features
   - Identify gaps and missing features
   - Implement Firebase compatibility in iOS app
   - Update UI/UX to match web experience
   - Test cross-platform functionality

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement Firebase Security Rules
   - Consider Firebase App Check
   - Review and enhance authentication flows
   - Implement secure data access patterns

## Known Issues

1. **CSP Security Concerns**
   - Current CSP includes 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval'
   - This is required for Firebase but reduces security benefits
   - Need to investigate alternatives or mitigations

2. **Firebase Authentication Edge Cases**
   - Some authentication flows may still have issues
   - Need to test all authentication methods thoroughly
   - Social authentication may require additional CSP directives
