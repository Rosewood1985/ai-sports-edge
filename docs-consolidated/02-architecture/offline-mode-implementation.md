# Offline Mode Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of offline mode in AI Sports Edge, which enables users to access and interact with the app even when they don't have an internet connection.

## Architecture Overview

The offline mode system consists of the following components:

1. **Offline Service**: Core service for managing offline functionality
2. **Data Caching**: Local storage of data for offline access
3. **Sync Queue**: Queue for storing operations performed while offline
4. **Network Status Monitoring**: Detection of online/offline status
5. **Offline Settings**: User-configurable settings for offline mode

## Components

### Offline Service

The `offlineService.ts` provides the core functionality for offline mode:

- **Network Status Monitoring**: Detect when the device goes online or offline
- **Data Caching**: Store data locally for offline access
- **Offline Operations**: Handle operations performed while offline
- **Sync Queue**: Synchronize offline operations when back online
- **Settings Management**: Manage user-configurable offline settings

```typescript
// Example: Initialize offline service
offlineService.initialize();

// Example: Check if network is available
const isOnline = offlineService.isNetworkAvailable();

// Example: Get data with offline support
const gameData = await offlineService.getData('games', 'game123');

// Example: Save data with offline support
await offlineService.saveData('games', gameData, 'game123');

// Example: Sync pending operations
await offlineService.syncPendingOperations();
```

### Data Caching

Data is cached locally using AsyncStorage to enable offline access:

- **Cache Keys**: Each cached item has a unique key based on collection and document ID
- **Cache Metadata**: Metadata is stored for each cached item, including size and expiration
- **Cache TTL**: Cached items expire after a configurable time to live (TTL)
- **Cache Size Limit**: The total cache size is limited to prevent excessive storage usage

```typescript
// Cache item structure
interface CacheItem<T> {
  data: T;
  timestamp: number;
  expiresAt: number;
}

// Cache metadata structure
interface CacheMetadata {
  key: string;
  timestamp: number;
  expiresAt: number;
  size: number;
}
```

### Sync Queue

Operations performed while offline are stored in a sync queue for later synchronization:

- **Operation Types**: Create, update, and delete operations are supported
- **Queue Storage**: The queue is stored in AsyncStorage
- **Retry Mechanism**: Failed operations are retried with exponential backoff
- **Error Handling**: Operations that fail repeatedly are removed from the queue
- **Queue Size Limit**: The queue size is limited to prevent excessive storage usage

```typescript
// Sync operation structure
interface SyncOperation {
  id: string;
  type: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';
  collection: string;
  docId?: string;
  data?: any;
  timestamp: number;
  attempts: number;
  lastAttempt?: number;
  error?: string;
}
```

### Network Status Monitoring

The app monitors network status changes to detect when the device goes online or offline:

- **NetInfo Integration**: Uses the @react-native-community/netinfo package
- **Event Listeners**: Notifies components when network status changes
- **Initial Status**: Checks the initial network status when the app starts
- **Auto Sync**: Automatically syncs pending operations when the device comes back online

```typescript
// Example: Add network status listener
const unsubscribe = offlineService.addListener((isOnline) => {
  console.log(`Network status changed: ${isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline'}`);
});
```

### Offline Settings

Users can configure offline mode settings to control behavior:

- **Enable/Disable**: Turn offline mode on or off
- **Cache Settings**: Configure caching behavior
- **Sync Settings**: Configure synchronization behavior
- **Storage Limits**: Set maximum cache and queue sizes

```typescript
// Offline mode settings structure
interface OfflineMode {
  enabled: boolean;
  cacheEnabled: boolean;
  syncEnabled: boolean;
  maxCacheSize: number; // in MB
  maxSyncQueueSize: number;
  cacheTTL: number; // in milliseconds
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow

1. **Reading Data**:
   - Check if data is in cache
   - If found and not expired, return cached data
   - If not found or expired and online, fetch from Firestore and cache
   - If not found or expired and offline, return null or empty array

2. **Writing Data**:
   - If online, write directly to Firestore
   - If offline, add to sync queue
   - When back online, process sync queue

3. **Deleting Data**:
   - If online, delete directly from Firestore
   - If offline, add to sync queue
   - When back online, process sync queue

### Caching Strategy

The app uses a time-based caching strategy with the following characteristics:

- **TTL-based Expiration**: Cached items expire after a configurable time to live
- **LRU Eviction**: Least recently used items are evicted when cache size limit is reached
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired items are automatically cleaned up
- **Manual Clearing**: Users can manually clear the cache

### Sync Strategy

The app uses a queue-based sync strategy with the following characteristics:

- **Operation-based Sync**: Each operation is stored and replayed in order
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last write wins for conflicts
- **Retry with Backoff**: Failed operations are retried with exponential backoff
- **Error Handling**: Operations that fail repeatedly are removed from the queue
- **Manual Sync**: Users can manually trigger synchronization

### Offline UI

The app provides visual indicators and feedback for offline mode:

- **Network Status Indicator**: Shows current network status
- **Offline Mode Indicator**: Shows when offline mode is active
- **Sync Status Indicator**: Shows sync progress and status
- **Error Messages**: Shows error messages for failed operations
- **Settings Screen**: Allows users to configure offline mode settings

## User Experience

### Offline Capabilities

The following features are available offline:

- **Viewing Data**: Users can view previously cached data
- **Creating Data**: Users can create new data, which will be synced later
- **Updating Data**: Users can update existing data, which will be synced later
- **Deleting Data**: Users can delete data, which will be synced later
- **Searching Data**: Users can search through cached data
- **Filtering Data**: Users can filter cached data

### Limitations

The following limitations apply when offline:

- **Fresh Data**: Users cannot access data that hasn't been cached
- **Real-time Updates**: Users cannot receive real-time updates
- **Media Content**: Large media content may not be available offline
- **Authentication**: Some authentication features may be limited
- **Third-party Services**: Features that rely on third-party services may be limited

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- **Sensitive Data**: Avoid caching sensitive data
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt cached data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Selective Sync**: Allow users to select which data to sync
2. **Background Sync**: Sync data in the background
3. **Conflict Resolution UI**: Provide UI for resolving sync conflicts

5. **Improved Compression**: Implement better data compression for cached data

## Conclusion

The offline mode implementation provides a robust foundation for enabling offline access and interaction with AI Sports Edge. By caching data locally and queuing offline operations, users can continue to use the app even when they don't have an internet connection, improving the overall user experience and engagement.
