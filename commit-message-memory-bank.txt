feat(tools): Implement comprehensive memory bank system

Implemented a complete memory bank system to improve code quality, reduce duplication, and enforce consistent practices:

- Created central memory bank file (.roocode/memory_bank.md) with core principles, project knowledge, and best practices
- Developed memory bank CLI tool (scripts/memory_bank.sh) for accessing and updating the memory bank
- Created file creation tool (scripts/new_file.sh) that checks for duplicates before creating new files
- Implemented code duplication detector (scripts/detect_duplicates.sh) to find and report code duplication
- Added smart logger (scripts/smart_logger.sh) for tracking development activities and project progress
- Integrated with Git hooks and workflow system for automatic enforcement
- Added comprehensive documentation (docs/memory-bank-system.md)

This system will help maintain code quality, reduce technical debt, and make onboarding easier for new developers.
