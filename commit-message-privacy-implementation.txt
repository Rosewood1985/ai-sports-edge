feat(privacy): Implement GDPR/CCPA compliance features

Add comprehensive privacy management system following atomic design:

- Data Layer (Atoms):
  - Update privacyTypes.ts with interfaces for data deletion requests
  - Enhance dataCategories.ts with canDelete property

- Business Logic Layer (Molecules):
  - Create DataAccessManager.ts for handling data access requests
  - Create DataDeletionManager.ts for handling data deletion requests
  - Create PrivacyManager.ts as main entry point for privacy functionality
  - Add index.js to export all privacy-related functionality

- UI Layer (Organisms):
  - Create PrivacySettingsScreen.tsx for managing privacy settings
  - Add index.js to export the privacy settings screen

This implementation follows GDPR and CCPA requirements, allowing users to:
- View and update privacy preferences
- Request access to personal data
- Request deletion of specific data categories or entire account
- Track status of privacy requests
