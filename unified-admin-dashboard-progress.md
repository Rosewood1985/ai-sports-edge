# Unified Admin Dashboard - Project Progress

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (COMPLETED)

**Date Completed:** May 22, 2025

### Accomplishments

- ✅ Created comprehensive technical specification document (`unified-admin-dashboard-technical-spec.md`)
- ✅ Defined project setup and configuration details
- ✅ Designed core layout components with TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Established authentication integration strategy with existing admin auth system
- ✅ Developed API service layer architecture with error handling and retry mechanisms
- ✅ Created integration strategy for compatibility with existing mobile admin screens

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Authentication Approach:**

   - Using Firebase Auth with custom JWT tokens
   - Implementing shared authentication middleware between web and mobile
   - Storing tokens in HTTP-only cookies for web security

2. **API Architecture:**

   - Implementing API gateway pattern for request routing
   - Using SWR for data fetching with stale-while-revalidate caching
   - Adding WebSocket integration for real-time updates

3. **UI Component Strategy:**
   - Converting React Native components to web equivalents
   - Maintaining consistent styling and behavior across platforms
   - Using responsive design for all screen sizes

### Next Steps (Phase 2)

- [ ] Draft technical specifications for all remaining phases (2-5)
- [ ] Implement Sentry configuration for error tracking
- [ ] Implement core layout components based on technical specification
- [ ] Set up authentication flow and protected routes
- [ ] Develop API service layer with error handling
- [ ] Create initial dashboard screens with placeholder data
- [ ] Integrate with existing admin APIs

### Priority Tasks

- [ ] Draft technical specifications for all phases (2-5)
- [ ] Implement Sentry configuration for error tracking
- [ ] Begin Phase 2 implementation after technical specification approval

## Future Phases

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation

- [ ] Implement bet slip performance monitoring
- [ ] Add conversion funnel tracking
- [ ] Develop advanced subscription analytics
- [ ] Create system health monitoring dashboard

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing

- [ ] Integrate with all existing admin APIs
- [ ] Implement real-time updates via WebSockets
- [ ] Perform cross-platform compatibility testing
- [ ] Conduct performance optimization

### Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- [ ] Create user documentation for admin dashboard
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Conduct security audit and penetration testing

## Technical Debt & Considerations

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing mobile admin screens
- Ensure consistent data models between web and mobile platforms
- Monitor performance metrics to maintain <200ms API response times
- Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the system
