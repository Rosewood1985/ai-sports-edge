ci(accessibility): Add Jest testing dependencies and CI/CD integration

- Add script to install Jest testing dependencies for TypeScript
- Update Jest configuration to properly support TypeScript testing
- Create GitHub Actions workflow for accessibility testing
- Implement color contrast testing with WCAG 2.1 validation
- Add Axe accessibility testing for web version
- Make all testing scripts executable

This change adds comprehensive accessibility testing to the CI/CD pipeline,
ensuring that accessibility issues are caught early in the development process.
The tests verify:
1. Component accessibility through unit tests
2. Color contrast compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards
3. Web accessibility using Axe for automated testing

These tools will help maintain accessibility standards across the app and
prevent regressions as new features are added.
