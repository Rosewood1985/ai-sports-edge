fix: ensure .htaccess is included in deployment

This commit fixes a critical deployment issue where the .htaccess file was being
systematically excluded from all deployments. The .htaccess file is essential for:

1. Setting proper Content-Security-Policy headers
2. Configuring X-Frame-Options via HTTP headers
3. Setting correct MIME types for JavaScript and JSON files
4. Enabling SPA routing for React

The fix includes:
- A new deployment script that explicitly includes .htaccess
- Proper CSP configuration that allows all required external resources
- Commenting out references to missing JS files in index.html

This resolves frontend rendering issues including:
- Black screen / infinite spinner
- X-Frame-Options errors
- Integrity check failures for external resources
- MIME type mismatches

Closes #ISSUE-123
