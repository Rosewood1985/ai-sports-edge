ci: Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment

- Created deploy-to-godaddy.yml workflow that:
  - Triggers on push to main branch
  - Uploads build folder via SFTP to GoDaddy server
  - Runs server-side fix script to set permissions and move files
  - Performs a basic health check on the deployed site

This workflow automates the entire deployment process, eliminating manual steps and ensuring consistent deployments. It securely stores credentials as GitHub secrets and provides immediate feedback on deployment status.
