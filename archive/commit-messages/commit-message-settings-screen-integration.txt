feat(ui): Add ThemeToggle to SettingsScreen

This commit integrates the ThemeToggle component from the atomic architecture into the SettingsScreen:

- Add variant="switch" prop to ThemeToggle component
- Maintain consistent UI with other toggle components
- Improve user experience for theme switching

This integration enhances the app's theme management capabilities and provides a more consistent user interface.
