feat(privacy): Update PrivacySettingsScreen to use privacyService

This commit updates the PrivacySettingsScreen component to use the new privacyService instead of directly using the privacy molecules. The changes include:

- Updated imports to use the privacyService from the atomic/organisms/privacy directory
- Modified data access and deletion request handlers to use the privacyService methods
- Updated the refresh logic to load both access and deletion requests
- Added PrivacySettingsScreen export to atomic/organisms/privacy/index.ts
- Added privacyService export to atomic/organisms/index.js
- Updated screens/PrivacySettingsScreen.tsx to import from the atomic/organisms/privacy directory

These changes improve the code organization by following the atomic architecture pattern and make the privacy features more maintainable by centralizing the privacy-related functionality in the privacyService.
