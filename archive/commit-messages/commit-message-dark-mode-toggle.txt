feat(theme): Implement standardized dark mode toggle component

This commit implements a standardized dark mode toggle component following the atomic architecture pattern. The implementation includes:

- New ThemeToggle molecule with multiple variants (button, switch, icon)
- Support for custom styling and labels
- Accessibility features for screen readers
- TypeScript type definitions for better developer experience
- Comprehensive example demonstrating all variants and usage patterns

This implementation provides a consistent way to toggle between light and dark themes across the application, improving user experience and accessibility.
