fix: Update SFTP configuration for reliable deployment

- Added "context": "./build" to specify the local folder to upload
- Set "uploadOnSave": false to prevent automatic uploads
- Enabled SFTP debug logging in VS Code settings
- Synchronized configuration between project root and vscode-sftp-deploy

This fixes the missing "Upload Folder" command issue by properly configuring the Natizyskunk SFTP extension with the correct context path and debug settings.
