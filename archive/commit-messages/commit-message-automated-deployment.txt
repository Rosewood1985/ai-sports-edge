feat: Add automated deployment and verification script

- Created automated-deploy-and-verify.sh script that:
  - Extracts SFTP credentials from configuration
  - Uploads build folder via SFTP using lftp
  - SSHs into server and runs fix script
  - Verifies .htaccess exists
  - Checks HTTP status of website
  - Verifies assets are loading
  - Runs detailed deployment check

This script automates the entire deployment process, from uploading the build folder to verifying the deployment, eliminating the need for manual steps and reducing the chance of deployment errors.
