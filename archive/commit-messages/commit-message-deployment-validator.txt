feat: Add deployment configuration validator

- Created validate-deployment-config.sh script that:
  - Ensures we're in the correct root workspace
  - Verifies .vscode/sftp.json is a symlink to vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json
  - Checks if build directory exists
  - Validates .htaccess exists in build directory (creates if missing)
  - Updates SFTP configuration with correct credentials

- Updated automated-deploy-and-verify.sh to run the validator before deployment

This ensures all deployment prerequisites are met before attempting to deploy, preventing common deployment issues and ensuring a consistent deployment process.
