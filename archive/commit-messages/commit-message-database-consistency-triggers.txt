feat: Implement database consistency triggers deployment system

This commit adds a comprehensive system for deploying and testing Firebase Cloud Functions
that maintain data consistency between duplicated fields in the database.

Key changes:
- Enhanced deploy-database-consistency-triggers.sh script with support for both interactive
  and service account key authentication
- Created test-triggers.js script for verifying trigger functionality
- Added detailed documentation in database-consistency-triggers-guide.md
- Implemented three database consistency triggers:
  * syncSubscriptionStatus: Syncs subscription status from subscriptions to users
  * syncCustomerId: Syncs customer ID from users to subscriptions
  * standardizeStatusSpelling: Standardizes "canceled"/"cancelled" spelling

These triggers ensure data consistency between the users collection and the subscriptions
subcollection, preventing data inconsistencies and improving data integrity.
