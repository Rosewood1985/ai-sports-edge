fix: Correct SFTP context path to fix config loading

- Changed "context": "./build" to "context": "build" in both SFTP config files
- Removed leading "./" which was causing the extension to look for config in build directory
- Maintains the intended functionality of uploading from the build directory
- Fixes "Config Not Found" error in VS Code SFTP extension

This fix resolves the path resolution issue where the SFTP extension was incorrectly looking for its configuration in the build directory instead of the .vscode directory.
