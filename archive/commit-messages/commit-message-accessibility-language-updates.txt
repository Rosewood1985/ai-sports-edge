fix(i18n): Update language files for accessibility

- Ensure Spanish translation has all accessibility-related strings
- Remove French language references from both English and Spanish files
- Maintain consistent terminology across all language files
- Update progress tracking in memory-bank

This change ensures that all accessibility features are properly localized
in both supported languages (English and Spanish) while removing references
to French which is not currently supported.
