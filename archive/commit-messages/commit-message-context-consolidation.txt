refactor(i18n): consolidate context providers into atomic structure

- Create atomic/organisms/i18n/I18nContext.tsx with enhanced type safety
- Create atomic/organisms/i18n/LanguageContext.tsx with simplified implementation
- Create atomic/molecules/language/LanguageSelector.tsx using atomic context
- Create script to update import paths across the codebase
- Update 27 files to use atomic context providers
- Document changes in memory-bank/progress.md

This consolidation follows atomic design principles by organizing context providers
in the appropriate atomic structure. It reduces code duplication and improves
maintainability by having a single source of truth for internationalization
functionality.
