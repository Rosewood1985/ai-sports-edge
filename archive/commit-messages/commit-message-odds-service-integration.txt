refactor(api): Integrate enhanced API service with OddsService

This commit integrates the enhanced API service with caching into the OddsService class:

- Replace direct axios calls with apiService.makeRequest
- Leverage the apiService's built-in caching mechanism
- Remove redundant caching logic from OddsService
- Update clearCache method to use apiService.clearCache
- Maintain the same API interface for backward compatibility

This integration improves performance by using a consistent caching strategy across the application and reduces code duplication.
