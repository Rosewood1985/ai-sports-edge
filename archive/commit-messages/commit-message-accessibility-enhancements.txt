feat(accessibility): Enhance atomic components with accessibility features

This commit adds accessibility features to the atomic components:

- Created AccessibleThemedText component that extends ThemedText with accessibility features
- Created AccessibleThemedView component that extends ThemedView with accessibility features
- Added comprehensive documentation for accessibility implementation
- Updated index.js to export the new components
- Updated .roo-todo.md to mark completed tasks

These changes improve the app's accessibility for users with disabilities by:
- Supporting screen readers with proper accessibility attributes
- Adding high contrast mode for users with visual impairments
- Supporting large text mode for users with visual impairments
- Supporting bold text mode for users with visual impairments
- Supporting reduced motion mode for users with vestibular disorders

The implementation follows best practices for accessibility in React Native and
provides a clear migration path for existing components.
