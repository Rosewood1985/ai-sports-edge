feat: Add deployment status check scripts

- Created check-deployment-status.sh for basic site accessibility checks
- Created detailed-deployment-check.sh for comprehensive diagnostics:
  - Server connectivity checks
  - SSH connection verification
  - File existence verification on server
  - Automatic fix script execution if needed
  - DNS resolution checks
  - HTTP response analysis

These scripts help diagnose deployment issues by providing detailed information about the server and website status, making it easier to troubleshoot deployment problems.
