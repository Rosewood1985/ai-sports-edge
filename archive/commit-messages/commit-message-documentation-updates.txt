Add and update documentation files for key project components:

- Create knowledge-edge-implementation-summary.md with detailed screen implementation
- Create backend-implementation-summary.md documenting all backend services
- Create react-components-library-summary.md with component overview
- Create implementation-summary.md tying all documentation together
- Update .roo-todo.md to mark betting slip feature tasks as completed
- Update betting-slip-feature-summary.md with new feature enhancements

Add performance optimization tasks to .roo-todo.md:

- Implement data synchronization for offline/online transitions
- Add offline caching for analytics dashboards
- Optimize database queries for better performance
- Implement query caching and pagination for large result sets
- Add request batching and retry logic for API calls
- Optimize payload size for mobile networks
- Implement comprehensive caching strategies with invalidation

These documentation files provide comprehensive details about the architecture,
implementation, and features of the AI Sports Edge application, improving
knowledge sharing and onboarding for new team members. The performance
optimization tasks will guide future development to enhance app responsiveness
and user experience.
