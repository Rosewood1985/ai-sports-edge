feat(accessibility): Implement accessibility testing and documentation

- Create unit tests for AccessibleThemedText component
- Implement color contrast testing utilities with WCAG 2.1 compliance checks
- Create comprehensive QA documentation for manual accessibility testing
- Update progress tracking in memory-bank

This change adds testing infrastructure for accessibility features, including:
1. Unit tests to verify accessible component behavior
2. Utilities to validate color contrast ratios against WCAG standards
3. Detailed QA guide for manual testing with screen readers and other assistive technologies

These tools will help ensure consistent accessibility implementation across the app
and provide a framework for validating compliance with accessibility standards.
