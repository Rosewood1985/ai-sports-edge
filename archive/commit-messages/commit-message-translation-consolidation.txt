feat(i18n): Consolidate translation files into atomic structure

- Created atomic/atoms/translations directory following atomic design principles
- Moved all translation files from translations/ to atomic/atoms/translations/
- Created atomic/atoms/translations/index.js for cleaner imports
- Updated I18nContext and LanguageContext to use atomic translations
- Created update-translation-imports.js script to update import paths
- Updated progress.md with documentation of the consolidation

This consolidation follows atomic design principles by organizing translations
at the atoms level, as they are fundamental building blocks used across the
application. The index.js file makes imports cleaner and more maintainable.
All functionality is preserved while reducing code duplication and improving
the overall architecture.
