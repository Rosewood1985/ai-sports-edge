fix: resolve frontend blocking issues for aisportsedge.app

- Remove X-Frame-Options meta tag from HTML files
- Set X-Frame-Options via .htaccess instead (SAMEORIGIN)
- Fix Google Fonts by adding proper crossorigin attribute
- Resolve Firebase MIME issues by creating firebase-config.js
- Update Content Security Policy in .htaccess to allow:
  * Google Tag Manager
  * Google Fonts
  * Firebase services
  * Unsafe-inline/eval temporarily for development
- Add proper MIME types for .mjs and .json files
- Centralize Firebase config in a single file

These changes resolve console errors and improve site loading by:
1. Moving security headers to server config where they belong
2. Fixing CORS issues with external resources
3. Ensuring Firebase loads with correct MIME type
4. Properly configuring CSP to allow required resources

Testing: Verified all pages load without console errors
