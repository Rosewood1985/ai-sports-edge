docs: Add comprehensive deployment guide

- Created deployment-guide.md that documents:
  - Three deployment options (GitHub Actions, Automated Script, Manual Fallback)
  - Step-by-step instructions for each deployment method
  - Troubleshooting steps for common deployment issues
  - Configuration details for deployment settings

This guide provides a single source of truth for all deployment-related information, making it easier for team members to understand and execute deployments consistently.
