     const eventId = sentryService.captureError(error, {
       screen: 'ErrorBoundary',
       action: 'component_crash',
       feature: 'error_handling',
       additionalData: {
         componentStack: errorInfo.componentStack,
         errorBoundaryLocation: 'root_error_boundary',
         userAgent: navigator?.userAgent || 'unknown',
         timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
       }
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Service Integration** (`/services/sentryService.ts`)
   - Centralized error capture with rich context
   - User identification and session tracking
   - Performance monitoring for screen transitions
   - Custom tags for feature-specific tracking

3. **Navigation Instrumentation**

   ```javascript
   function wrapScheduledFunction(cronName, schedule, handler, options = {}) {
     return async (context) => {
       const checkInId = Sentry.captureCheckIn({
         monitorSlug: cronName,
         status: 'in_progress',
       });
       
       try {
         const result = await handler(context);
         Sentry.captureCheckIn({
           checkInId,
           monitorSlug: cronName,
           status: 'ok',
           duration: Date.now() - startTime,
         });
         return result;
       } catch (error) {
         Sentry.captureCheckIn({
           checkInId,
           monitorSlug: cronName,
           status: 'error',

     Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
       message: `Function ${functionName} completed`,
       category: 'performance',
       level: success ? 'info' : 'error',
       data: { duration, success, functionName }
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Database Performance**
   - Firestore query execution time tracking
   - Large document operation monitoring
   - Connection failure detection and alerting

3. **API Response Time Monitoring**

8. Performance degradation (function execution time > 30s, memory usage > 80%)
9. Scheduled function failures (cron job missed executions, timeout errors)

**User Experience Alerts**
10. High error rate (error rate > 5% in 5-minute window)
11. Frontend crashes (React Native ErrorBoundary triggers)
12. Critical path failures (login, signup, payment flow errors)

#### **Source Maps & Debug Information**

     test('captures errors with proper context', async () => {
       const errorId = await sentryService.captureError(testError, testContext);
       expect(errorId).toBeDefined();
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Manual Testing Scripts**

### Technical Evolution

The technical architecture has evolved significantly:

1. **Initial Prototype**: Basic React Native app with Firebase
2. **Architecture Refinement**: Implementation of atomic design
3. **Backend Enhancement**: Advanced Firebase integration
4. **Performance Optimization**: Improved loading and rendering
5. **Scalability Improvements**: Enhanced data models and API design

Abandoned approaches included:

- Pure Redux state management (complexity outweighed benefits)

### Implementation Journey

The security and privacy features are being implemented according to the plan outlined in [`memory-bank/gdpr-ccpa-compliance-plan.md`](memory-bank/gdpr-ccpa-compliance-plan.md):

1. **Basic Security**: Initial authentication and authorization âœ…

   - Implemented Firebase Authentication (May 2024)
   - Added secure API handling with JWT tokens

2. **Core Infrastructure**: GDPR/CCPA compliance foundation âœ…

   - Commit: `feat(privacy): Implement GDPR/CCPA compliance framework` (May 20, 2025)
   - Added privacy configuration settings and feature flags
   - Defined TypeScript interfaces for privacy-related data structures
   - Created data category definitions and field mappings

3. **User Rights Implementation**: ðŸ“‹ Planned (May 29 - June 5, 2025)

   - Data access implementation
   - Data deletion implementation
   - Data portability implementation

4. **Consent Management**: ðŸ“‹ Planned (June 6 - June 13, 2025)

   - Consent collection
   - Consent management
   - Privacy preferences

5. **User Interface**: ðŸ“‹ Planned (June 14 - June 21, 2025)
   - Privacy dashboard
   - Request management UI
   - Preference management UI

**Failed Approaches:**

- Initial attempt to use a third-party GDPR compliance library (April 2025)

  - Issue: Library didn't support React Native well
  - Resolution: Decided to build custom implementation following atomic architecture

- Attempted to implement consent management without proper data structures (May 2025)
  - Issue: Consent records weren't properly typed and validated
  - Resolution: Created comprehensive type definitions in `privacyTypes.ts`

**Challenges:**

- Balancing security with user experience
  - Current solution: Progressive disclosure of privacy information
- Implementing compliant consent management
  - Current status: UI components created but backend functionality incomplete
- Managing third-party service security
  - Current solution: Service-specific data processors defined in configuration

**Documentation vs. Implementation Gap:**
The current documentation describes the complete planned implementation, but only Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure) has been completed. The UI components exist but many don't have full functionality yet.
