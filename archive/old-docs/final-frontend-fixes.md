# Final Frontend Fixes for AI Sports Edge âœ…

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Content Security Policy
- Removed inline CSP `<meta>` tags from HTML files
- Added proper CSP in `.htaccess`:
  ```
  <IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set Content-Security-Policy "script-src 'self' https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com"
  </IfModule>
  ```
- Added X-Frame-Options header to prevent clickjacking:
  ```
  Header set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
  ```

### 2. Fixed MIME Type Issues
- Added MIME type rules in `.htaccess`:
  ```
  AddType application/javascript .js
  AddType text/css .css
  ```
- Ensures all JavaScript files are served with correct MIME type

### 3. Removed Integrity and Crossorigin Attributes
- Removed `crossorigin` attribute from Google Fonts links in:
  - `/dist/index.html`
  - `/dist/login.html`
  - `/dist/homepage-preview.html`
- Prevents integrity check failures that block font loading

### 4. Replaced Google Fonts with System Fonts
- Removed Google Fonts links completely
- Updated font-family declarations to use system fonts:
  ```css
  font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
  ```
- Eliminates external font dependencies that could be blocked by CSP

### 5. Disabled Service Worker
- Commented out service worker registration script
- Removed service-worker.js file
- Prevents service worker conflicts with CSP

## Deployment
- Rebuilt `/dist` directory with `npx expo export --platform web`
- Deployed using secure SFTP script: `./scripts/test-secure-deploy.sh`
- Committed changes with tag: `frontend-final-cleanup-v1.0`

## Verification Steps
1. Visit https://aisportsedge.app in incognito mode
2. Check browser console for any CSP or MIME errors
3. Confirm Firebase authentication works
4. Test language toggle functionality
5. Verify routing between pages

## Why This Works
These changes fix frontend blockers by eliminating CSP violations, ensuring correct MIME types, removing problematic integrity checks, and replacing external font dependencies with system fonts. The X-Frame-Options header adds an extra layer of security against clickjacking attacks.
