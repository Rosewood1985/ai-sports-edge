# AI Sports Edge - UI/UX Design System Refinement Strategy

This document outlines the plan for refining the UI/UX design system for the AI Sports Edge mobile (iOS) and web (React Native for Web) applications.

## Phase 1: Establish Core Design Principles & Foundations

*   **Define Guiding Principles:** Solidify core aesthetic goals (e.g., "Futuristic & Data-Driven Clarity," "Trustworthy Insights," "Engaging & Responsive").
*   **Spacing & Grid System:** Recommend a consistent spacing scale (e.g., 4px or 8px base unit) and basic grid layout guidelines.
*   **Color Palette Refinement:**
    *   Define precise shades (black, neon blue, grays).
    *   Assign roles to colors (background, primary action, accents, etc.).
    *   Detail usage for confidence indicators (green/yellow/red).
    *   Review contrast ratios (WCAG AA).
*   **Typography Hierarchy:**
    *   Define sizes, weights, line heights for Orbitron (Headlines) and Inter (Body).
    *   Establish clear hierarchy rules (H1, H2, Body, etc.).

## Phase 2: Component-Level Styling & Interaction

*   **Component Audit & Refinement:** Systematically review key UI components:
    *   Cards: Structure, padding, borders (neon glow?), info density.
    *   Buttons: Primary (glowing?), secondary, tertiary styles; hover/tap states.
    *   Badges/Tags: Styling for readability.
    *   Info Panels/Modals: Layouts, typography, actions.
    *   Input Fields: Appearance, labels, validation.
    *   Navigation (Tabs/Menus): Active states, interaction.
*   **Motion & Interaction:**
    *   Subtle animations for state changes (loading, presses).
    *   Smooth screen transitions or micro-interactions.

## Phase 3: Screen Layout Recommendations

*   **Key Screen Analysis:** Provide layout suggestions for:
    *   Home Screen: Info density, CTAs, game hierarchy.
    *   Game Detail Screen: Structure for stats, predictions, odds.
    *   My Bets Screen: Presentation of active/past bets, status, summaries.
    *   Profile/Settings Screen: Grouping of user info, preferences, actions.
*   **Layout Principles:** Emphasize alignment, spacing, hierarchy, platform conventions.

## Phase 4: Dark Mode Polish

*   **Adding Depth:** Use lighter dark grays for elevated surfaces.
*   **Glow Effects:** Refine neon glows for primary actions/active states.
*   **Readability:** Ensure sufficient contrast and appropriate font weights.

## Phase 5: Platform-Specific Considerations

*   **iOS:** Adhere to Human Interface Guidelines (navigation, touch targets).
*   **Web (React Native for Web):** Address responsiveness, hover states, navigation patterns.

## Phase 6: Deliverable Format

*   **Structure:** Organize suggestions logically (by principle, component, screen).
*   **Language:** Provide suggestions in English and Spanish.
*   **Format:** Present in structured text (Markdown).
