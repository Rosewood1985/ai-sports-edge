## 🛑 Governance Rule – File & Execution Clarity

Any automated or AI-generated file, task, or command **must clearly indicate** if it needs to be:

- ✅ Saved to the project directory
- 🔁 Deployed to cron, Olive, or scheduling systems
- 📤 Uploaded to Adobe Express, social media platforms, or shared libraries
- 📓 Logged in `task-board.md`, `scheduled-posts/`, `feature-log.md`, etc.

This is required for all Olive responses, ChatGPT outputs, and internal team tasks to avoid omissions or shadow edits.
