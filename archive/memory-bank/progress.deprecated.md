## Pending Migrations

## Migration Patterns Applied

- Replaced direct Firebase imports with atomic architecture imports
- Updated Firestore operations to use firebaseService.firestore methods
- Updated Firebase Functions calls to use firebaseService.functions.callFunction
- Added proper type assertions for backward compatibility
- Maintained consistent error handling patterns

## Next Steps

1. Identify remaining files that need migration
2. Prioritize based on dependencies and complexity
3. Create automated tests to verify functionality after migration
4. Update documentation to reflect new patterns

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Structure Maintenance

To maintain the clean structure of this document:

1. **Section Organization**: Keep all entries under their appropriate sections
2. **Formatting Consistency**: Maintain consistent markdown formatting
3. **Entry Format**: Follow the established table format for migrations
4. **Deduplication**: Before adding new entries, check for similar existing entries (≥85% similarity)

### Version Tracking

This document uses version tracking to prevent duplication:

- **Version Tag**: The `<!-- ROO-MERGE-COMPLETE: YYYY-MM-DD -->` tag at the top indicates the last merge/cleanup date
- **Update Process**: When making significant changes, update this tag with the current date
- **Merge Strategy**: When merging from multiple sources, preserve the most recent and complete information

## Memory Bank Consolidation System Implementation (2025-05-13)

Implemented a persistent rule system for managing the memory bank with automatic consolidation:

### Trigger Conditions
- Automatic consolidation triggers when:
  - 2+ files have ≥75% topic overlap (similar keywords like "Firebase", "auth", "API key", etc.)
  - OR share system-level tags like #infra, #firebase, #security, #deployment

### Consolidation Process
1. **Cluster** related files using fuzzy matching to group by theme
2. **Select a base file** - the most refined and up-to-date file as the primary version
3. **Consolidate** - merge all content into one canonical file following naming conventions
4. **Archive deprecated fragments** - rename merged files with `.deprecated.md` or move to `/archive/memory-bank/`
5. **Log the merge** - update checkpoint and status log files
6. **Notify** if there are conflicting advice or ambiguity

### Implementation Components
- Created `scripts/memory-bank-consolidation.js` - Main consolidation script
- Created `scripts/setup-memory-bank-consolidation.sh` - Setup script for triggers
- Created `scripts/ensure-node.sh` - Node.js environment setup script
- Created `memory-bank/background-consolidation-authority.md` - Documentation
- Added automatic triggers for:
  - New memory-bank file additions
  - Context reload events
  - Manual prompts with "consolidate"
- Added Node.js environment management:
  - Automatic Node.js installation via nvm
  - Version control via .nvmrc
  - Package manager configuration
- Added large file handling:
  - Files >100MB analyzed using system tags and filenames only
  - Files >2GB handled gracefully without memory errors
  - Grep-based scanning for system tags in large files
  - Metadata-only merging for large files

This implementation ensures the memory bank remains organized, reduces duplication, and improves knowledge management efficiency while maintaining consistent Node.js environments across different systems.
