## Current Implementation Focus

### Memory Bank Consolidation System

The memory bank consolidation system has been implemented to automatically identify and merge related files in the memory bank:

1. **Automatic Triggers**: Consolidation runs when:
   - 2+ files have ≥75% topic overlap (similar keywords)
   - Files share system-level tags like #infra, #firebase, #security, #deployment
   - New files are added to the memory bank
   - Context is reloaded
   - Manual prompt includes "consolidate"

2. **Consolidation Process**:
   - Cluster related files using fuzzy matching
   - Select the most refined file as the base
   - Merge content into a canonical file with proper naming conventions
   - Archive deprecated files with clear notices
   - Log the merge in checkpoint and status files
   - Notify of any conflicts or ambiguities

3. **Implementation Components**:
   - `scripts/memory-bank-consolidation.js`: Main consolidation script with large file handling
   - `scripts/setup-memory-bank-consolidation.sh`: Setup script for triggers
   - `scripts/ensure-node.sh`: Node.js environment setup script
   - `memory-bank/background-consolidation-authority.md`: Documentation
   - Integration with existing background consolidation processes

This system ensures the memory bank remains organized, reduces duplication, and improves knowledge management efficiency while handling files of any size.

### Task Caching System

The task caching system has been implemented to provide a structured approach to task management with the following features:

1. **Centralized Storage**: All tasks are stored in `memory-bank/todo.json` in a structured JSON format
2. **Fuzzy Matching**: Tasks with >70% similarity are considered duplicates to prevent redundancy
3. **Status Tracking**: Tasks can be marked as pending, in-progress, or completed
4. **Priority Levels**: Tasks can be assigned low, medium, or high priority
5. **Source Tracking**: Each task records its source (file or location)
6. **Memory Bank Integration**: Tasks are synchronized with activeContext.md, progress.md, and decisionLog.md
7. **Command-Line Interface**: Bash aliases and functions provide easy access to task management

### Integration with Context Tagging

The task caching system is integrated with the existing context tagging system:

1. When a `// ROO-TASK:` tag is added to a file, it automatically creates a task in `todo.json`
2. The `scripts/tag-context.sh` script has been updated to call `manage-tasks.sh` for task management
3. The `sync-tasks-with-memory-bank` function ensures memory bank files are kept in sync with the task cache

### Documentation Optimization

Recent improvements to the documentation system include:

1. **Progress Tracking Cleanup**: The `progress.md` file has been deduplicated and optimized
2. **Version Tracking**: Added timestamp markers to track document versions
3. **Maintenance Guidelines**: Added guidelines for maintaining clean document structure
4. **Decision Documentation**: Updated `decisionLog.md` with rationale for documentation changes
5. **Reporting**: Created a comprehensive report of cleanup activities and improvements
