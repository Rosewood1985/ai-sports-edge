# SFTP Deployment Standardization

**Date:** April 22, 2025
**Task:** Standardize SFTP deployment configuration for AI Sports Edge

## Problem

The project had multiple SFTP configuration files with inconsistent settings, leading to:
- Deployment confusion
- Potential security issues
- Inconsistent file uploads
- No cleanup of old files

## Solution

### 1. Configuration Standardization

- Deleted duplicate SFTP configs
- Set single source of truth at `vscode-sftp-deploy/.vscode/sftp.json`
- Updated configuration with:
  - SFTP protocol (port 22) for secure transfers
  - Proper host, credentials and paths
  - `uploadOnSave: true` enabled
  - `localPath: "./dist"` to deploy only production assets

### 2. Deployment Scripts

Created a suite of deployment scripts:

- `scripts/check-sftp-configs.sh` - Detects and removes duplicate configs
- `scripts/check-sftp-sync.sh` - Checks for mismatched files between local/remote
- `scripts/sftp-deploy-cleanup.sh` - Handles remote cleanup and verification:
  - Removes `.html`, `.js`, `.css`, `.map`, `.json` files before upload
  - Preserves `assets/`, `images/`, `locales/` folders
  - Verifies `index.html` exists and matches local hash after deployment
- `scripts/pre-deploy-checks.sh` - Runs all checks before deployment
- `scripts/quick-deploy.sh` - Fast deployment option that skips checks
- `scripts/deployment-checklist.sh` - Interactive guided deployment with step-by-step confirmation

### 3. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/sftp-deployment.md` with:
- Configuration details
- Script usage instructions
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting tips

## Deployment Options

1. **Guided Interactive Deployment** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deployment-checklist.sh
   ```
   - Validates configuration and local files
   - Offers interactive guided deployment with confirmation at each step
   - Provides manual instructions if guided deployment is declined

2. **Standard Deployment** (With all checks)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pre-deploy-checks.sh
   ```
   - Runs all configuration and sync checks
   - Offers to proceed with deployment if checks pass

3. **Quick Deployment** (For rapid iterations)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/quick-deploy.sh
   ```
   - Skips checks but still performs cleanup and verification

## Benefits

- **Security**: SFTP protocol instead of FTP (encrypted connection)
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth for credentials
- **Reliability**: Pre-deployment validation and hash verification
- **Cleanliness**: Remote cleanup to prevent stale files
- **Flexibility**: Multiple deployment options for different scenarios
- **Guidance**: Interactive deployment for new team members

## Future Improvements

- Add GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD
- Implement rollback functionality
- Add deployment notifications (Slack, email)
- Create deployment logs for auditing
