# AI Sports Edge Features Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the AI Sports Edge features, including the AI Pick of the Day system, ML training and inference pipeline, and supporting components. The implementation follows the architecture plan with modular components, Firebase SDK v9, and TypeScript throughout.

## Components Implemented

### ML Pipeline

1. **prepare_dataset.py**
   - Connects to Firestore to fetch completed games data
   - Extracts relevant fields for model training
   - Saves data as CSV for local model training

2. **feature_engineering.py**
   - Loads the raw dataset
   - Adds derived features like sharpEdgeSignal, lineMoveImpact, publicFadeScore
   - Exports enhanced dataset for training

3. **train_model.py**
   - Loads the enhanced dataset
   - Trains an XGBoost model
   - Evaluates model performance
   - Saves the trained model

4. **predict_outcome.py**
   - Loads the trained model
   - Takes in live game data
   - Returns prediction and adjusted confidence

5. **train_and_push.sh**
   - Runs all training scripts in sequence
   - Saves the model
   - Deploys the model to Firebase Storage

### Firebase Cloud Functions

1. **markAIPickOfDay.ts**
   - Runs daily at 9AM ET
   - Queries today's games from Firestore
   - Selects top prediction as AI Pick of the Day
   - Updates Firestore with the pick

2. **predictTodayGames.ts**
   - Runs daily at 10AM ET
   - Fetches today's games from Firestore
   - Uses prediction API to generate predictions
   - Writes predictions back to Firestore

3. **updateStatsPage.ts**
   - Runs weekly on Sundays
   - Calculates win percentages by confidence tier
   - Updates stats collection in Firestore
   - Provides data for StatsScreen

### Frontend Components

1. **AIPickCard.tsx**
   - Displays team matchup (teamA vs teamB)
   - Shows confidence indicator (color-coded bar)
   - Displays momentum score
   - Shows AI insight text
   - Includes follow button (optional)

2. **LeaderboardScreen.tsx**
   - Displays ranking of AI picks by performance
   - Shows win/loss record for different time periods
   - Includes confidence average
   - Filters by sport

3. **StatsScreen.tsx**
   - Displays AI win percentage breakdown by confidence tier
   - Shows simple bar charts for stats
   - Includes performance metrics by sport

### Deployment

1. **deploy-ai-features.sh**
   - Builds and deploys ML model
   - Builds and deploys Firebase Functions
   - Builds and deploys frontend components
   - Updates Remote Config

## Integration Points

1. **Firebase Firestore**
   - Games collection: Stores game data and predictions
   - aiPicksOfDay collection: Stores historical AI Picks of the Day
   - stats collection: Stores performance statistics

2. **Firebase Functions**
   - Scheduled triggers for daily and weekly tasks
   - Firestore triggers for real-time updates

3. **Frontend**
   - React Native components for displaying AI picks
   - Integration with existing navigation system
   - Theme support for light/dark modes

## Deployment Status

The implementation is complete and has been deployed to the following environments:

- **ML Model**: Deployed to Firebase Storage
- **Firebase Functions**: Deployed to Firebase Cloud Functions
- **Frontend Components**: Deployed to Firebase Hosting

## Next Steps

1. **Monitoring**
   - Set up monitoring for ML model performance
   - Track user engagement with AI picks
   - Monitor Firebase Function execution

2. **Optimization**
   - Fine-tune ML model based on performance
   - Optimize Firebase Function execution
   - Improve frontend component performance

3. **Expansion**
   - Add more sports and leagues
   - Implement user feedback mechanism
   - Develop personalized AI picks

## Conclusion

The AI Sports Edge features have been successfully implemented according to the architecture plan. The system is now ready for user testing and feedback. The modular design allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements.
