## Current Implementation Focus

### Task Caching System

The task caching system has been implemented to provide a structured approach to task management with the following features:

1. **Centralized Storage**: All tasks are stored in `memory-bank/todo.json` in a structured JSON format
2. **Fuzzy Matching**: Tasks with >70% similarity are considered duplicates to prevent redundancy
3. **Status Tracking**: Tasks can be marked as pending, in-progress, or completed
4. **Priority Levels**: Tasks can be assigned low, medium, or high priority
5. **Source Tracking**: Each task records its source (file or location)
6. **Memory Bank Integration**: Tasks are synchronized with activeContext.md, progress.md, and decisionLog.md
7. **Command-Line Interface**: Bash aliases and functions provide easy access to task management

### Integration with Context Tagging

The task caching system is integrated with the existing context tagging system:

1. When a `// ROO-TASK:` tag is added to a file, it automatically creates a task in `todo.json`
2. The `scripts/tag-context.sh` script has been updated to call `manage-tasks.sh` for task management
3. The `sync-tasks-with-memory-bank` function ensures memory bank files are kept in sync with the task cache

### Documentation Optimization

Recent improvements to the documentation system include:

1. **Progress Tracking Cleanup**: The `progress.md` file has been deduplicated and optimized
2. **Version Tracking**: Added timestamp markers to track document versions
3. **Maintenance Guidelines**: Added guidelines for maintaining clean document structure
4. **Decision Documentation**: Updated `decisionLog.md` with rationale for documentation changes
5. **Reporting**: Created a comprehensive report of cleanup activities and improvements
