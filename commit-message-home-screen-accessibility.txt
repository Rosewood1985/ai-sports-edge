feat(accessibility): Integrate AccessibleThemedText and AccessibleThemedView in HomeScreen

This commit enhances the accessibility of the HomeScreen by:

- Replacing all ThemedText components with AccessibleThemedText
- Replacing all ThemedView components with AccessibleThemedView
- Adding appropriate accessibility labels and hints for screen readers
- Using semantic type props (h1, h2, h3, bodyStd, etc.) for proper heading hierarchy
- Maintaining consistent styling while improving accessibility

These changes improve the app's accessibility compliance and provide a better
experience for users with disabilities, particularly those using screen readers.
