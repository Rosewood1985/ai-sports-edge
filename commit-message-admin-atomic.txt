feat(admin): implement admin dashboard atomic components

This commit implements the admin dashboard components following atomic design principles:

Atoms:
- StatusIndicator: Visual indicator for status (success, warning, error, info)
- MetricCard: Card component for displaying metrics with trend indicators

Molecules:
- MetricsPanel: Panel for displaying multiple metrics in a grid layout

Organisms:
- AdminHeader: Header component with user info, notifications, and actions
- AdminSidebar: Sidebar navigation with collapsible items and badges
- AdminDashboard: Main dashboard component combining header, sidebar, and content

Templates:
- AdminLayout: Template for consistent admin page layout

These components provide a foundation for building admin interfaces with a consistent design and behavior. They are designed to be modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.

Part of the admin dashboard refactoring initiative outlined in the admin-atomic-architecture.md document.
