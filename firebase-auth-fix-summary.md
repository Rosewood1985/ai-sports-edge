# Firebase Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue
Firebase authentication was failing with error: `Firebase: Error (auth/api-key-not-valid.-please-pass-a-valid-api-key.)`

## Root Cause
1. Missing Firebase configuration values in `.env.production`
2. Incorrect order of environment variable loading in webpack
3. Using Android app ID format instead of web app ID format

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Environment Variables
Added missing Firebase configuration values to `.env.production`:
```
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://ai-sports-edge.firebaseio.com
FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-ABCDEF1234
```

### 2. Fixed Webpack Configuration
Updated `webpack.prod.js` to:
- Load environment variables from .env.production first
- Then define them for the application
- Added missing environment variables to DefinePlugin

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
Added detailed error handling to login.html files:
- Validates Firebase config before initialization
- Logs detailed error information to console
- Displays errors on the UI for easier debugging

### 4. Deployment
Created a deployment script `deploy-firebase-fix.sh` that:
- Creates backups of modified files
- Builds the project with the new configuration
- Deploys to production

## How to Deploy
Run the deployment script:
```bash
./deploy-firebase-fix.sh
```

## Verification
After deployment, verify that:
1. Firebase authentication works correctly
2. Users can sign up and log in
3. No API key errors appear in the console

## Rollback Plan
If issues persist, restore from backups in `./backups/YYYYMMDD/` directory.
