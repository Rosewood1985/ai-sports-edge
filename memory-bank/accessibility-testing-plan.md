# Accessibility Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to testing the accessibility features of AI Sports Edge. It covers unit testing, color contrast testing, screen reader testing, and QA documentation for manual testing.

## Current Status: In Progress ðŸ”„

## 1. Unit Tests for Accessible Components

### Approach

We will create Jest unit tests for our atomic accessible components to ensure they maintain their accessibility properties and behavior. These tests will verify:

1. **Proper prop forwarding**: Ensure accessibility props are correctly passed to underlying components
2. **Default accessibility values**: Verify sensible defaults are provided when specific props are not set
3. **Semantic type handling**: Test that semantic types (h1, h2, etc.) are correctly applied
4. **Accessibility state management**: Verify that components correctly manage and update accessibility states

### Components to Test

- AccessibleThemedText
- AccessibleThemedView
- AccessibleTouchableOpacity
- Other composite accessible components

### Implementation Plan

1. Create test files in `__tests__/accessibility/` directory
2. Implement snapshot tests for basic rendering
3. Implement specific tests for accessibility props
4. Add tests for edge cases and error handling

## 2. Color Contrast Testing

### Approach

We will implement automated color contrast testing to ensure our UI meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards (minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text).

### Implementation Plan

1. Create a utility function to calculate contrast ratios between colors
2. Implement tests that verify our theme colors meet contrast requirements
3. Add tests for specific component combinations
4. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline to catch contrast issues early

### Tools

- [react-native-wcag-color-contrast](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-wcag-color-contrast)
- Custom testing utilities

## 3. Screen Reader Testing

### Approach

We will test our app with screen readers on both iOS (VoiceOver) and Android (TalkBack) to ensure a good experience for users with visual impairments.

### Test Cases

1. **Navigation flow**: Verify logical navigation through the app
2. **Element identification**: Ensure all elements are properly announced
3. **Custom actions**: Test that custom actions are properly exposed
4. **Dynamic content updates**: Verify that screen readers announce dynamic content changes
5. **Form interactions**: Test form filling and submission with screen readers

### Implementation Plan

1. Create a testing checklist for each screen
2. Document expected behavior for each interaction
3. Test on real devices with VoiceOver and TalkBack
4. Document issues and prioritize fixes

## 4. QA Documentation for Manual Accessibility Testing

### Approach

We will create comprehensive documentation for QA testers to manually verify accessibility features.

### Documentation Components

1. **Testing checklists**: Screen-by-screen checklists for accessibility features
2. **Expected behaviors**: Documentation of expected screen reader announcements
3. **Testing procedures**: Step-by-step guides for testing with assistive technologies
4. **Common issues**: Documentation of common accessibility issues and how to identify them
5. **Regression testing**: Guidelines for regression testing after fixes

### Implementation Plan

1. Create a master accessibility testing document
2. Develop screen-specific testing guides
3. Create video demonstrations of proper accessibility behavior
4. Develop a reporting template for accessibility issues

## Next Steps

1. Set up Jest testing environment for accessibility components
2. Create initial unit tests for AccessibleThemedText
3. Implement color contrast calculation utility
4. Begin documenting screen reader testing procedures
