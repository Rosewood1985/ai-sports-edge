# Consolidation Discovery Log

This document tracks files and code patterns identified for consolidation across the AI Sports Edge codebase.

## Overview

This log was generated as part of a system-wide search for previously started tasks related to:
- Consolidation and migration
- Dashboard development
- Recurring job automation
- Orphaned or duplicated feature code

## Consolidation Candidates

### Firebase Integration

| File Path | Pattern | Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| src/firebase/config.js | Firebase initialization | Candidate for consolidation | Should be migrated to atomic architecture |
| src/config/firebase.js | Firebase initialization | Consolidated version | This is the target for consolidation |
| src/config/firebase.ts | Firebase initialization | TypeScript version | This is the preferred implementation |
| services/firebaseService.ts | Firebase service | Consolidated service | This is the target service for all Firebase operations |

### Dashboard Components

| File Path | Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| src/atomic/organisms/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx | Admin Dashboard | Active | Main dashboard component |
| src/atomic/organisms/admin/AdminHeader.tsx | Admin Header | Active | Header for admin dashboard |
| src/atomic/organisms/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx | Admin Sidebar | Active | Sidebar for admin dashboard |
| src/atomic/templates/AdminLayout.tsx | Admin Layout | Active | Layout template for admin pages |
| src/atomic/molecules/admin/MetricsPanel.tsx | Metrics Panel | Active | Dashboard metrics component |
| src/atomic/atoms/admin/MetricCard.tsx | Metric Card | Active | Individual metric display |
| src/atomic/atoms/admin/StatusIndicator.tsx | Status Indicator | Active | Status indicator component |

### Recurring Jobs

| File Path | Job Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| .cronrc | Cron configuration | Active | Main cron job configuration |
| scripts/start-cronrc.sh | Cron runner | Active | Script to start cronrc-runner.js |
| scripts/cronrc-runner.js | Cron implementation | Active | JavaScript implementation of cron runner |
| scripts/update-app-history.sh | History backfill | New | Script to update app history |

### Duplicated Code

| File Path | Pattern | Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| services/analyticsService.js | Analytics service | Legacy | Should be consolidated with analyticsService.ts |
| services/analyticsService.ts | Analytics service | Current | TypeScript version is the target |
| services/userPreferencesService.js | User preferences | Legacy | Should be consolidated with userPreferencesService.ts |
| services/userPreferencesService.ts | User preferences | Current | TypeScript version is the target |
| services/aiPredictionService.ts.bak | AI prediction | Backup | Should be removed or consolidated |
| services/aiPredictionService.ts | AI prediction | Current | Current implementation |

## Action Items

1. Continue Firebase migration to atomic architecture
2. Consolidate analytics services into TypeScript version
3. Remove backup (.bak) files after verifying current implementations
4. Update .cronrc to include the new backfill-history task

## Next Steps

1. Review this log with the development team
2. Prioritize consolidation tasks
3. Update todo.json with new consolidation tasks
4. Schedule regular consolidation sprints
