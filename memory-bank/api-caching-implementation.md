# API Caching Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented an enhanced API caching mechanism for the AI Sports Edge application. This implementation follows the atomic architecture pattern and provides a consistent caching solution for all API calls.

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created

1. **atomic/molecules/cache/apiCache.ts**

   - Provides a generic caching mechanism for API responses
   - Includes functions for generating cache keys, getting/saving from/to cache, and invalidating cache
   - Implements a `cachedRequest` function that handles the caching logic

2. **atomic/molecules/cache/index.js**

   - Exports the apiCache functionality

3. **atomic/organisms/api/apiService.ts**

   - Enhanced API service that uses the apiCache molecule
   - Provides consistent caching for all API calls
   - Includes configurable cache options for different endpoints

4. **atomic/organisms/api/index.js**

   - Exports the apiService functionality

5. **docs/implementation-guides/api-caching.md**
   - Documentation for the API caching mechanism

### Modified Files

1. **atomic/organisms/index.js**
   - Added export for apiService

### Key Features

1. **Generic Caching**

   - The caching mechanism can be used with any API endpoint
   - Cache keys are generated based on the endpoint and query parameters

2. **Configurable Cache TTL**

   - Different endpoints can have different cache expiration times
   - Default TTL is 5 minutes, but can be overridden for specific endpoints or requests

3. **Memory and Storage Caching**

   - Data is cached both in memory for fast access and in AsyncStorage for persistence
   - Memory cache has a maximum size to prevent memory issues

4. **Automatic Cache Invalidation**

   - Cache entries are automatically invalidated when they expire
   - Expired entries are removed from both memory and storage

5. **Manual Cache Invalidation**

   - Cache can be manually invalidated for specific endpoints or all endpoints
   - Useful when data is updated and cache needs to be refreshed

6. **Cache Control**
   - API calls can specify whether to use cache or not
   - Only GET requests are cached by default

### Implementation Approach

1. **Atomic Architecture**

   - Followed the atomic architecture pattern
   - Created a molecule for the cache functionality
   - Created an organism for the API service

2. **Backward Compatibility**

   - The enhanced API service maintains the same interface as the original
   - Existing code can use the new service without changes

3. **Performance Optimization**

   - Used memory cache for fast access
   - Used AsyncStorage for persistence
   - Implemented cache size limits to prevent memory issues

4. **Error Handling**
   - Added proper error handling for all cache operations
   - Gracefully falls back to API requests when cache operations fail

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Using Both Memory and Storage Cache

**Decision**: Implement both in-memory and AsyncStorage caching.

**Rationale**:

- Memory cache provides fast access to frequently used data
- AsyncStorage provides persistence across app restarts
- Combined approach gives the best of both worlds

### 2. Configurable Cache TTL

**Decision**: Allow different cache TTL for different endpoints.

**Rationale**:

- Different types of data have different update frequencies
- Game data changes more frequently than trending data
- Configurable TTL allows for fine-tuning based on data characteristics

### 3. Cache Key Generation

**Decision**: Generate cache keys based on endpoint and query parameters.

**Rationale**:

- Ensures different API calls with different parameters have different cache keys
- Allows for more granular cache control
- Makes it easier to invalidate specific cache entries

### 4. Cache Only GET Requests

**Decision**: Only cache GET requests by default.

**Rationale**:

- GET requests are typically read-only and safe to cache
- POST, PUT, DELETE requests typically modify data and shouldn't be cached
- Follows HTTP semantics

## Future Improvements

1. **Cache Compression**

   - Compress cached data to reduce storage usage
   - Especially useful for large responses

2. **Cache Prioritization**

   - Prioritize cache entries based on usage patterns
   - Keep frequently accessed data in memory longer

3. **Background Sync**

   - Sync cached data with the server in the background
   - Useful for offline-first functionality

4. **Cache Analytics**

   - Track cache hit/miss rates
   - Use analytics to optimize cache settings

5. **Offline Mode**
   - Enhance the caching system to support full offline mode
   - Allow the app to function without network connectivity
