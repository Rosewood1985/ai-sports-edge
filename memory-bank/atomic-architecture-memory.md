# Atomic Architecture Memory

## Overview

This memory file contains key information about the atomic architecture implementation for the AI Sports Edge app. It serves as a reference for future development and maintenance.

## Key Concepts

The atomic architecture is based on the atomic design principles, organizing components into a hierarchy based on their complexity and reusability:

1. **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (e.g., envConfig, firebaseApp, themeColors)
2. **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms (e.g., themeContext, firebaseAuth)
3. **Organisms**: Complex components (e.g., environmentBootstrap, firebaseService)
4. **Templates**: Layout structures (e.g., MainLayout)
5. **Pages**: Complete screens (e.g., HomePage, SignupPage, ForgotPasswordPage)

## Implementation Details

### Core Modules

1. **Environment Module**

   - Handles environment configuration and validation
   - Provides a consistent way to access environment variables
   - Ensures required configuration is present

2. **Firebase Module**

   - Manages Firebase initialization and services
   - Provides authentication and Firestore functionality
   - Abstracts Firebase-specific implementation details

3. **Theme Module**

   - Manages theme configuration and context
   - Provides theme switching functionality
   - Ensures consistent styling across the application

4. **Monitoring Module**
   - Handles error tracking and logging
   - Provides performance monitoring
   - Ensures consistent error handling

### Migration Process

The migration process follows these steps:

1. **Analyze the component**

   - Identify dependencies
   - Determine the appropriate atomic level
   - Identify shared functionality

2. **Create the atomic component**

   - Create the component file in the appropriate directory
   - Migrate the code, updating imports
   - Add proper documentation

3. **Create tests**

   - Create test file in the appropriate directory
   - Write tests for the component
   - Ensure good test coverage

4. **Update index files**

   - Add the component to the appropriate index file
   - Update imports in other components

5. **Verify functionality**
   - Run tests to ensure the component works
   - Manually test if necessary

## Tools and Scripts

1. **deploy-atomic.sh**

   - Deploys atomic components
   - Runs tests and ESLint
   - Creates documentation

2. **cleanup-atomic.sh**

   - Cleans up atomic components
   - Removes unused files
   - Updates imports

3. **complete-atomic-migration.sh**

   - Assists with migrating remaining components
   - Creates component and test files
   - Updates index files

4. **deploy-atomic-to-main.sh**
   - Deploys atomic architecture to main branch
   - Creates pull request
   - Merges changes

## Documentation

1. **atomic-architecture-summary.md**

   - Overview of the architecture
   - Implementation details
   - Benefits and next steps

2. **atomic-migration-plan.md**

   - Phased approach for migration
   - Testing strategy
   - Timeline and success criteria

3. **atomic-next-steps.md**
   - Immediate actions
   - Short-term tasks
   - Long-term vision

## Testing

1. **Jest Configuration**

   - Custom configuration for atomic components
   - JSDOM environment for React component testing
   - Mocks for external dependencies

2. **Test Setup**

   - Mocks for React Native components
   - Mocks for Firebase services
   - Mocks for navigation

3. **Component Tests**
   - Tests for atoms, molecules, organisms, and pages
   - Coverage reporting
   - Integration with CI/CD pipeline

## Best Practices

1. **Component Organization**

   - Each component should have a single responsibility
   - Components should be organized by complexity
   - Dependencies should flow from simple to complex

2. **Naming Conventions**

   - Atoms: lowercase, descriptive names (e.g., envConfig)
   - Molecules: camelCase, descriptive names (e.g., themeContext)
   - Organisms: camelCase, service-oriented names (e.g., firebaseService)
   - Templates: PascalCase, layout-oriented names (e.g., MainLayout)
   - Pages: PascalCase, screen-oriented names (e.g., HomePage)

3. **File Structure**

   - Each component should have its own file
   - Index files should export all components
   - Tests should mirror the component structure

4. **Documentation**
   - Each component should have JSDoc comments
   - Props and state should be documented
   - Usage examples should be provided

## Lessons Learned

1. **Migration Challenges**

   - Identifying the appropriate atomic level for components
   - Managing dependencies between components
   - Ensuring backward compatibility

2. **Testing Challenges**

   - Mocking external dependencies
   - Testing React Native components
   - Ensuring good test coverage

3. **Documentation Challenges**
   - Keeping documentation up-to-date
   - Providing clear examples
   - Ensuring consistency across components

## Future Improvements

1. **Component Library**

   - Create a standalone component library
   - Publish components for reuse
   - Add comprehensive documentation

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Implement code splitting
   - Add lazy loading
   - Optimize bundle size

3. **Accessibility**
   - Audit components for accessibility
   - Implement accessibility improvements
   - Add accessibility tests
