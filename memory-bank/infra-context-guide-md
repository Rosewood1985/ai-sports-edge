# Memory Bank Consolidation System

This document describes the automatic memory bank consolidation system that helps maintain a clean, organized, and efficient memory bank by consolidating related files.

## Automatic Triggers

The consolidation system is automatically triggered when:

1. **New files are added** to the memory-bank directory
   - A file watcher checks for new files every 5 minutes
2. **Context reload** occurs via the `update-memory-bank.js` script
   - The consolidation runs after each memory bank update
3. **Background consolidation** runs via the `background-consolidate.sh` script
   - Part of the regular maintenance process

## Best Practices

To work effectively with the consolidation system:

1. **Use consistent naming** for related files
2. **Add system tags** (`#infra`, `#firebase`, etc.) to help identify related files
3. **Use clear section headings** to help the system identify and merge content correctly
4. **Include citations and sources** at the end of files to preserve attribution
5. **Maintain the `.nvmrc` file** to ensure consistent Node.js versions

## Completed Migrations

## Conclusion

The memory bank consolidation system helps maintain a clean, organized, and efficient memory bank by automatically identifying and merging related files. This reduces duplication, improves knowledge organization, and makes it easier to find and use information in the memory bank.

## Conflict Resolution

When the system detects conflicts between files (significantly different content in the same sections), it:

1. Keeps both versions of the content
2. Adds a note indicating the conflict
3. Logs the conflict in the checkpoint and status files

## Consolidation Process

When the system identifies files that should be consolidated, it follows this process:

1. **Cluster** related files using fuzzy matching to group by theme
2. **Select a base file** - the most refined and up-to-date file as the primary version
3. **Consolidate** - merge all content into one canonical file following naming conventions:
   - `firebase-[topic]-overview.md` or `deployment-security-guide.md`
   - Preserves citations and source comments at the end
4. **Archive deprecated fragments** - rename merged files with `.deprecated.md` or move to `/archive/memory-bank/`
   - Adds deprecation notice: `# ❌ Deprecated – merged into [new filename]`
5. **Log the merge** - update checkpoint and status log files:
   - `/context/latest-checkpoint.md`
   - `/status/status-log.md`
6. **Notify** if there are conflicting advice or ambiguity

## Implementation Details

The consolidation system consists of several components:

1. **`memory-bank-consolidation.js`** - The main script that performs the consolidation
2. **`setup-memory-bank-consolidation.sh`** - Sets up the triggers and hooks
3. **`ensure-node.sh`** - Ensures Node.js is installed and properly configured
4. **`watch-memory-bank.sh`** - Watches for new files in the memory bank
5. **`context-reload-hook.sh`** - Runs after context reload
6. **`consolidate-memory-bank.sh`** - Manual trigger script

## Large File Handling

The consolidation system includes special handling for large files:

1. **Size Detection** - Files larger than 100MB are detected automatically
2. **Limited Analysis** - Large files are analyzed using system tags and filenames only
3. **Grep-Based Scanning** - System tags are detected using grep instead of loading the entire file
4. **Metadata-Only Merging** - When consolidating large files, only metadata is merged, not content
5. **Reference Preservation** - The consolidated file includes references to the original large files
6. **Error Handling** - Files larger than 2GB are handled gracefully without crashing

This approach ensures the system can handle files of any size without running into memory limitations.

## Logs and Status

The consolidation system maintains logs and status information in:

- **`logs/memory-bank-consolidation.log`** - Detailed log of consolidation activities
- **`context/latest-checkpoint.md`** - Record of consolidation checkpoints
- **`status/status-log.md`** - Summary of consolidation activities

## Maintenance

The consolidation system is designed to run automatically, but you can:

1. **Review the logs** periodically to ensure it's working correctly
2. **Manually trigger** consolidation if you notice duplication
3. **Update the configuration** in `memory-bank-consolidation.js` if needed

## Manual Consolidation

You can also manually trigger the consolidation process by:

1. Running the consolidation script directly:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/consolidate-memory-bank.sh
   ```

2. Using the word "consolidate" in a prompt, which will automatically trigger the consolidation process

## Memory Bank Consolidation System Implementation (2025-05-13)

Implemented a persistent rule system for managing the memory bank with automatic consolidation:

## Migration Patterns Applied

- Replaced direct Firebase imports with atomic architecture imports
- Updated Firestore operations to use firebaseService.firestore methods
- Updated Firebase Functions calls to use firebaseService.functions.callFunction
- Added proper type assertions for backward compatibility
- Maintained consistent error handling patterns

## Next Steps

1. Identify remaining files that need migration
2. Prioritize based on dependencies and complexity
3. Create automated tests to verify functionality after migration
4. Update documentation to reflect new patterns

## Node.js Environment

The consolidation system requires Node.js to run. The system includes an automatic Node.js setup script:

1. **`ensure-node.sh`** - Checks if Node.js is installed and installs it if necessary
   - Uses nvm (Node Version Manager) to install and manage Node.js
   - Reads the `.nvmrc` file to determine which Node.js version to use
   - Falls back to Node.js v18 if no `.nvmrc` file is found
   - Enables corepack for package manager version control
   - Installs dependencies if needed

All scripts that use Node.js will automatically check for its presence and install it if necessary.

## Overview

The memory bank consolidation system automatically identifies and merges related files in the memory bank to reduce duplication and improve knowledge organization. It follows a set of rules to determine when files should be consolidated and how the consolidation should be performed.

**Note:** Alternative content from progress.md:

This document tracks the progress of migrating service files to the Firebase atomic architecture.

## Pending Migrations

| Service File | Status | Priority | Notes |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------|

## Progress Summary

- **Total Files**: 188
- **Migrated Files**: 188
- **Pending Files**: 0
- **Completion**: 100%

## Trigger Conditions

The system automatically consolidates memory bank files when:

- 2 or more files in `/roocode/memory_bank.md` or the `memory-bank` directory:
  - Share ≥75% topic overlap (similar keywords in title or content like "Firebase", "auth", "API key", "headers", "deployment", "CSP", etc.)
  - OR share system-level tags like `#infra`, `#firebase`, `#security`, `#deployment`

### 1. Centralized Firebase Service

**Decision**: Create a centralized firebaseService in the atomic architecture's organisms layer.

**Date**: Prior to current migration

**Context**: Previously, Firebase was initialized and accessed directly in multiple service files, leading to code duplication and potential inconsistencies.

**Rationale**:
- Follows atomic design principles by encapsulating Firebase as an organism
- Provides a single point of initialization and configuration
- Makes testing easier through centralized mocking
- Improves maintainability by isolating Firebase-specific code

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Context-based Firebase provider: Rejected due to complexity and potential performance issues
- Higher-order component pattern: Rejected as less suitable for service-oriented architecture

### 1. Function-by-Function Migration Approach

**Decision**: Migrate each function individually rather than rewriting entire files.

**Date**: 2025-05-12

**Context**: Service files contain many functions with complex logic.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces risk by allowing incremental testing
- Makes it easier to identify and fix issues
- Allows for partial rollback if needed

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Complete file rewrites: Higher risk and more difficult to test
- Parallel implementation: Would lead to code duplication

### 10. Background Consolidation System Implementation

**Decision**: Implement a comprehensive background consolidation system to automate file management, deduplication, and context synchronization tasks.

**Date**: 2025-05-13

**Context**: The project needed a unified approach to file management, deduplication, and context synchronization that could run automatically in the background.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces manual effort in maintaining project cleanliness
- Ensures consistent handling of duplicate files and tags
- Automates synchronization between code tags and memory bank
- Provides a unified approach to file archiving and cleanup
- Establishes a single source of truth for consolidation operations

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `scripts/background-consolidate.sh` with five key sections:
  - DETECT CANDIDATES: Functions to identify files for processing
  - DEDUPLICATE TAGS: Functions to remove redundant tags
  - MERGE CONTEXT: Functions to combine related context data
  - REMOVE LEGACY: Functions to clean outdated files
  - SYNC WITH MEMORY BANK: Functions to update memory storage
- Added `.cronrc` entry to run every 12 minutes with label `consolidate`
- Created `memory-bank/consolidation-components-found.md` for analysis of consolidation components
- Created `memory-bank/background-consolidation-authority.md` for standing authority directives

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Multiple specialized scripts: Would be more modular but harder to maintain
- Event-driven approach: Would be more responsive but more complex
- Manual consolidation: Would be more controlled but less consistent

### 11. Narrative Context Tagging System Implementation

**Decision**: Implement a narrative context tagging system to identify and manage strategic documentation files.

**Date**: 2025-05-13

**Context**: The project needed a way to identify, tag, and manage important documentation files that contain strategic vision, user flow psychology, design decisions, and investor insights.

**Rationale**:
- Provides a systematic way to identify and track important narrative documents
- Establishes a clear tagging convention for strategic documentation
- Facilitates future consolidation of strategic vision and architecture information
- Integrates with the existing memory bank and context management system
- Supports the document consolidation and strategic context principles

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `scripts/tag-narrative-context.sh` to tag specified narrative context files
- Tagged primary candidates with `<!-- ROO-NARRATIVE-CONTEXT -->`
- Created `status/essential-documents.md` to maintain a canonical log of key files
- Updated memory-bank files with narrative context references
- Added document consolidation and strategic context principles to `background-consolidation-authority.md`
- Added to `.cronrc` to run daily for continuous scanning and tagging

**Future Plan**:
- Once other merges complete, consolidate narrative context files into a single, well-formatted document
- Create a comprehensive vision and system architecture document with sections for vision, design philosophy, feature summary, architecture summary, investor overview, and timeline

### 12. System Health Check Implementation

**Decision**: Implement a modular system health check script to consolidate verification tasks.

**Date**: 2025-05-13

**Context**: The project had multiple scripts and cron jobs for various verification tasks, which could lead to sprawl and maintenance challenges.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces sprawl by consolidating multiple verification tasks into a single script
- Provides a modular structure that can be easily extended with new verification modules
- Centralizes logging and reporting for system health
- Improves maintainability by having a single entry point for system verification
- Follows the principle of having one script with pluggable checks that can grow cleanly

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `scripts/system-health-check.sh` with modular function blocks:
  - `verify_consolidation_principles`: Checks adherence to consolidation principles
  - `verify_atomic_architecture`: Verifies atomic architecture structure
  - `verify_memory_bank_consistency`: Ensures memory bank files are present and up-to-date
  - `verify_narrative_context_tagging`: Checks for narrative context tags in key files
- Implemented structured logging to separate files:
  - `status/consolidation-compliance.md`: Records compliance with system principles
  - `status/consolidation-violations.md`: Records violations of system principles
  - `status/system-health-summary.md`: Provides a brief summary of all module results
- Added to `.cronrc` to run every 3 days with label `system-health`
- Designed to reference `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` for behavioral rules

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Multiple specialized scripts: Would be more modular but lead to sprawl
- Event-driven verification: Would be more responsive but more complex
- Manual verification: Would be more controlled but less consistent and more labor-intensive

### 2. Preserve Error Handling Patterns

**Decision**: Maintain existing error handling patterns during migration.

**Date**: 2025-05-12

**Context**: Different services have established error handling patterns.

**Rationale**:
- Maintains consistency with existing code
- Reduces risk of introducing new bugs
- Preserves expected behavior for error cases

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Standardize error handling: Would be more consistent but higher risk
- Enhanced error reporting: Would be beneficial but outside migration scope

### 2. Type Assertions for Backward Compatibility

**Decision**: Use type assertions (e.g., `(result as any).status`) when accessing Firebase function results.

**Date**: 2025-05-12

**Context**: The migration to atomic architecture changed the return type of Firebase function calls, potentially breaking existing code.

**Rationale**:
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- Avoids extensive refactoring of dependent components
- Provides a clear migration path without breaking changes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Define explicit interfaces: Would be cleaner but require more extensive changes
- Use unknown type with type guards: More type-safe but more verbose

### 3. Path-Based Document References

**Decision**: Use path strings instead of document references for Firestore operations.

**Date**: 2025-05-12

**Context**: The original code used Firestore document references, while the atomic architecture uses path strings.

**Rationale**:
- Simplifies the API surface
- Makes code more readable and less verbose
- Encapsulates Firestore-specific details in the firebaseService

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep using document references: Would require more complex wrapper functions
- Hybrid approach: Would lead to inconsistent patterns

### 3. Task Caching System Implementation

**Decision**: Implement a structured task caching system in `todo.json` with integration to memory bank files.

**Date**: 2025-05-13

**Context**: The project needed a unified approach to task management that integrates with the existing context tagging system.

**Rationale**:
- Provides a single source of truth for task management
- Implements fuzzy matching to avoid duplicate tasks
- Integrates with memory bank files for consistent context tracking
- Supports prioritization and status tracking of tasks
- Enables better workflow through bash aliases and functions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- External task tracking tool: Would fragment context across systems
- Simple text-based TODO list: Lacks structure and integration capabilities
- Extending tag-context.sh: Would mix concerns and complicate the script

### 4. Progress Tracking File Cleanup and Standardization

**Decision**: Clean up and standardize the progress.md file to improve readability and maintainability.

**Date**: 2025-05-13

**Context**: The progress.md file had accumulated numerous duplicate entries and test data, making it difficult to read and maintain.

**Rationale**:
- Improves readability by removing duplicate entries
- Preserves all important progress information
- Establishes clear structure for future updates
- Adds version tracking to prevent future duplication
- Provides maintenance guidelines for consistent formatting

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Automated cleanup script: Would be more efficient but risk losing important information
- Complete rewrite: Would be cleaner but risk losing historical context
- Minimal cleanup: Would be safer but not address structural issues

**Implementation Details**:
- Used fuzzy matching with ≥85% similarity threshold to identify duplicates
- Preserved the most complete/recent version of duplicates
- Added timestamp marker for version tracking
- Created maintenance guidelines section
- Preserved original log data in a collapsible section for reference

Last updated: 2025-05-13 20:43:32

### 5. Adoption of .cronrc as Declarative Scheduler

**Decision**: Adopted `.cronrc` as a declarative scheduler for recurring system jobs.

**Context**: The existing consolidation process needed improvements to handle growing complexity.

**Rationale**:
- Improves data integrity through backfilling missing information
- Reduces redundancy through task deduplication
- Enhances traceability with marker integration
- Creates canonical logs for historical reference

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `task-rolling-log.md` and `app-history.md` as canonical logs

### 7. Introduction of Scheduler Validation Log

**Decision**: Introduced `status/cron-validation-log.md` for scheduler optimization.

**Date**: 2025-05-13

**Context**: The scheduler needed a way to validate and optimize its operations.

**Rationale**:
- Provides visibility into scheduler performance
- Helps identify optimization opportunities
- Facilitates troubleshooting of scheduler issues
- Enables data-driven improvements to scheduling

### 8. Formalization of Weekly Maintenance

**Decision**: Formalized `full-sweep.sh` as weekly maintenance orchestrator.

- Added large file handling:
  - Files >100MB analyzed using system tags and filenames only
  - Files >2GB handled gracefully without memory errors
  - Grep-based scanning for system tags in large files
  - Metadata-only merging for large files

This implementation ensures the memory bank remains organized, reduces duplication, and improves knowledge management efficiency while maintaining consistent Node.js environments across different systems.

### Integration with Context Tagging

The task caching system is integrated with the existing context tagging system:

1. When a `// ROO-TASK:` tag is added to a file, it automatically creates a task in `todo.json`
2. The `scripts/tag-context.sh` script has been updated to call `manage-tasks.sh` for task management
3. The `sync-tasks-with-memory-bank` function ensures memory bank files are kept in sync with the task cache

### Memory Bank Consolidation System

The memory bank consolidation system has been implemented to automatically identify and merge related files in the memory bank:

1. **Automatic Triggers**: Consolidation runs when:
   - 2+ files have ≥75% topic overlap (similar keywords)
   - Files share system-level tags like #infra, #firebase, #security, #deployment
   - New files are added to the memory bank
   - Context is reloaded
   - Manual prompt includes "consolidate"

2. **Consolidation Process**:
   - Cluster related files using fuzzy matching
   - Select the most refined file as the base
   - Merge content into a canonical file with proper naming conventions
   - Archive deprecated files with clear notices
   - Log the merge in checkpoint and status files
   - Notify of any conflicts or ambiguities

3. **Implementation Components**:
   - `scripts/memory-bank-consolidation.js`: Main consolidation script with large file handling
   - `scripts/setup-memory-bank-consolidation.sh`: Setup script for triggers
   - `scripts/ensure-node.sh`: Node.js environment setup script
   - `memory-bank/background-consolidation-authority.md`: Documentation
   - Integration with existing background consolidation processes

This system ensures the memory bank remains organized, reduces duplication, and improves knowledge management efficiency while handling files of any size.

### Pending Tasks

- **[medium]** Implement error handling for edge cases (Source: test-tag-context.js, ID: 0)

### Structure Maintenance

To maintain the clean structure of this document:

1. **Section Organization**: Keep all entries under their appropriate sections
2. **Formatting Consistency**: Maintain consistent markdown formatting
3. **Entry Format**: Follow the established table format for migrations
4. **Deduplication**: Before adding new entries, check for similar existing entries (≥85% similarity)

### Task Caching System

The task caching system has been implemented to provide a structured approach to task management with the following features:

1. **Centralized Storage**: All tasks are stored in `memory-bank/todo.json` in a structured JSON format
2. **Fuzzy Matching**: Tasks with >70% similarity are considered duplicates to prevent redundancy
3. **Status Tracking**: Tasks can be marked as pending, in-progress, or completed
4. **Priority Levels**: Tasks can be assigned low, medium, or high priority
5. **Source Tracking**: Each task records its source (file or location)
6. **Memory Bank Integration**: Tasks are synchronized with activeContext.md, progress.md, and decisionLog.md
7. **Command-Line Interface**: Bash aliases and functions provide easy access to task management

### Trigger Conditions

- Automatic consolidation triggers when:
  - 2+ files have ≥75% topic overlap (similar keywords like "Firebase", "auth", "API key", etc.)
  - OR share system-level tags like #infra, #firebase, #security, #deployment

### Version Tracking

This document uses version tracking to prevent duplication:

- **Version Tag**: The `<!-- ROO-MERGE-COMPLETE: YYYY-MM-DD -->` tag at the top indicates the last merge/cleanup date
- **Update Process**: When making significant changes, update this tag with the current date
- **Merge Strategy**: When merging from multiple sources, preserve the most recent and complete information
