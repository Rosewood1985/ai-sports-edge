## Migration Patterns Applied

- Replaced direct Firebase imports with atomic architecture imports
- Updated Firestore operations to use firebaseService.firestore methods
- Updated Firebase Functions calls to use firebaseService.functions.callFunction
- Added proper type assertions for backward compatibility
- Maintained consistent error handling patterns

## Next Steps

1. Identify remaining files that need migration
2. Prioritize based on dependencies and complexity
3. Create automated tests to verify functionality after migration
4. Update documentation to reflect new patterns

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Structure Maintenance

To maintain the clean structure of this document:

1. **Section Organization**: Keep all entries under their appropriate sections
2. **Formatting Consistency**: Maintain consistent markdown formatting
3. **Entry Format**: Follow the established table format for migrations
4. **Deduplication**: Before adding new entries, check for similar existing entries (≥85% similarity)

### Version Tracking

This document uses version tracking to prevent duplication:

- **Version Tag**: The `<!-- ROO-MERGE-COMPLETE: YYYY-MM-DD -->` tag at the top indicates the last merge/cleanup date
- **Update Process**: When making significant changes, update this tag with the current date
- **Merge Strategy**: When merging from multiple sources, preserve the most recent and complete information
