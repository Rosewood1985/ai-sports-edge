# Dependency Update Process

## Overview

This document tracks the process of updating dependencies for the AI Sports Edge application. The goal is to ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date, secure, and compatible with the application.

## Current Status

- Executed the dependency update script to check for outdated packages
- Checked for security vulnerabilities
- Lockfile age is 1 day, which is within the acceptable range (less than 30 days)

## Dependency Update Script

The `scripts/update-dependencies.js` script provides several options for updating dependencies:

1. Patch updates only (safest)
2. Minor and patch updates (recommended)
3. All updates including major versions (may break compatibility)
4. Update specific packages
5. Security-focused updates (prioritizes fixing vulnerabilities)
6. Check for security vulnerabilities
7. Exit

The script includes safety features such as:

- Creating backups before updates
- Running tests after updates to verify functionality
- Restoring backups if tests fail
- Checking for peer dependency issues

## Update Strategy

Our update strategy follows these principles:

1. **Security First**: Prioritize fixing security vulnerabilities
2. **Stability**: Prefer patch and minor updates over major updates
3. **Compatibility**: Ensure updates don't break existing functionality
4. **Testing**: Verify all updates with automated tests
5. **Documentation**: Document all updates and their impact

## React Native Considerations

When updating React Native dependencies, we need to be especially careful with:

- React and React Native versions (must be compatible)
- Native modules that may require additional configuration
- Expo SDK compatibility
- iOS and Android platform-specific issues

## Next Steps

1. Complete security vulnerability check
2. Apply security-focused updates if needed
3. Apply patch and minor updates
4. Test the application thoroughly
5. Document any breaking changes or required adjustments
6. Update the todo list to mark the dependency update task as completed
