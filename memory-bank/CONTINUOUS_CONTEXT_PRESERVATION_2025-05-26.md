### Code Patterns Established
```typescript
// Optimized Firebase Query Pattern
const data = await optimizedQuery('collection_name')
  .where('field', '==', 'value')
  .orderBy('timestamp', 'desc')
  .limit(50)
  .execute({
    useCache: true,
    cacheTtl: 300000, // 5 minutes
    enableMetrics: true,
  });

// Performance Monitoring Pattern
const { recordRender } = usePerformanceMonitoring('ComponentName');

// Betting Service Integration Pattern
const betId = await betTrackingService.placeBet({
  userId,
  betType: 'parlay',
  selections: optimizedLegs,
  stake: kellyOptimalStake,
  confidence: aiConfidence,
});
