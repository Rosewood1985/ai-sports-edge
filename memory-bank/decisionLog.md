# Decision Log

## Stripe Integration Testing Implementation

### March 20, 2025

#### Decision: Use Jest Mocks Instead of Actual API Calls
- **Decision**: Implement tests using Jest mocks rather than making actual API calls to Stripe.
- **Context**: Testing payment processing requires interaction with Stripe's API, which would create real charges and subscriptions if not mocked.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Use Stripe's test mode with test API keys
  2. Create a mock Stripe server
  3. Use Jest mocks to simulate Stripe API responses
- **Reasoning**: Jest mocks provide the most isolated and consistent testing environment without requiring external dependencies or risking accidental charges.
- **Implications**: Tests will be faster and more reliable, but won't catch issues with the actual Stripe API integration. Additional integration tests with Stripe's test environment may be needed in the future.

#### Decision: Organize Tests by Functional Area
- **Decision**: Organize tests by functional area (configuration, subscriptions, purchases, webhooks, security) rather than by component.
- **Context**: Stripe integration spans multiple components and services in the application.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Organize tests by component (one test file per component)
  2. Organize tests by user flow (one test file per user flow)
  3. Organize tests by functional area (one test file per functional area)
- **Reasoning**: Functional area organization provides better coverage of specific aspects of the Stripe integration and makes it easier to ensure comprehensive testing of each area.
- **Implications**: This organization makes it clear what functionality is being tested, but may result in some overlap between test files.

#### Decision: Implement a Shell Script for Test Orchestration
- **Decision**: Create a shell script to run all Stripe tests and generate coverage reports.
- **Context**: Running multiple test files individually is cumbersome and doesn't provide a comprehensive view of test coverage.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Use Jest's built-in test discovery
  2. Create a JavaScript test runner
  3. Create a shell script for test orchestration
- **Reasoning**: A shell script provides the most flexibility for running tests in a specific order, with custom output formatting, and generating coverage reports.
- **Implications**: The script is platform-specific (Unix/Linux/macOS) and may need to be adapted for Windows environments.

#### Decision: Include Security-Specific Tests
- **Decision**: Create a dedicated test file for security aspects of the Stripe integration.
- **Context**: Payment processing requires strict security measures to protect sensitive information.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Include security tests in each functional area test file
  2. Create a separate security test file
  3. Rely on manual security testing
- **Reasoning**: A dedicated security test file ensures that security concerns are explicitly addressed and not overlooked.
- **Implications**: This approach highlights the importance of security in payment processing and provides a clear checklist of security measures that must be implemented.

#### Decision: Mock File System for Security Tests
- **Decision**: Use mocks for file system operations in security tests rather than reading actual files.
- **Context**: Security tests need to verify that certain patterns exist in the codebase without being affected by changes to the actual files.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Read actual files during tests
  2. Use static strings for expected patterns
  3. Mock file system operations
- **Reasoning**: Mocking file system operations provides a consistent testing environment and allows tests to run without depending on the actual file contents.
- **Implications**: Tests may not catch issues if the mock content doesn't accurately reflect the actual file content. The mocks will need to be updated if the file content changes significantly.

## Pre-Deployment Completion Plan

### March 21, 2025

#### Decision: Prioritize Subscription Features for Implementation
- **Decision**: Prioritize the implementation of subscription bundles and usage-based billing before other features.
- **Context**: The subscription model is a core part of the business model and revenue generation.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Prioritize enhanced player statistics
  2. Prioritize geolocation features
  3. Prioritize betting analytics
  4. Prioritize subscription features
- **Reasoning**: Subscription features directly impact revenue and user conversion, making them the highest priority for implementation.
- **Implications**: This prioritization will delay the implementation of other features, but will ensure that the core revenue-generating features are in place for launch.

#### Decision: Implement Usage-Based Billing with Stripe Metered Subscriptions
- **Decision**: Use Stripe's metered subscriptions feature for implementing usage-based billing.
- **Context**: Usage-based billing requires tracking usage and charging users based on their actual usage.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Implement custom usage tracking and billing
  2. Use a third-party usage billing service
  3. Use Stripe's metered subscriptions
- **Reasoning**: Stripe's metered subscriptions provide a robust, well-documented solution that integrates well with our existing Stripe implementation.
- **Implications**: This approach leverages Stripe's infrastructure but requires implementing usage tracking and reporting to Stripe.

#### Decision: Create a Comprehensive Pre-Deployment Plan
- **Decision**: Create a detailed pre-deployment plan with specific tasks, timelines, and dependencies.
- **Context**: The project has multiple features in various states of completion that need to be finalized before deployment.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Focus on one feature at a time without a comprehensive plan
  2. Create a high-level plan without detailed tasks
  3. Create a comprehensive plan with detailed tasks and timelines
- **Reasoning**: A comprehensive plan provides clarity on what needs to be done, helps with resource allocation, and ensures that all necessary tasks are completed before deployment.
- **Implications**: This approach requires more upfront planning but will result in a more organized and efficient implementation process.

#### Decision: Implement a Phased Deployment Approach
- **Decision**: Implement a phased deployment approach, starting with the web app and followed by the iOS app.
- **Context**: Deploying both the web app and iOS app simultaneously increases complexity and risk.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Deploy web app and iOS app simultaneously
  2. Deploy web app first, then iOS app
  3. Deploy iOS app first, then web app
- **Reasoning**: Deploying the web app first allows for faster iteration and testing before submitting to the App Store, which has a longer review process.
- **Implications**: This approach reduces risk but delays the iOS app launch. It also allows for addressing any issues discovered in the web app before the iOS app is submitted for review.

#### Decision: Implement Post-Deployment Monitoring from Day One
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and analytics from the first day of deployment.
- **Context**: Monitoring and analytics are crucial for understanding user behavior, identifying issues, and making data-driven decisions.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Implement basic monitoring only
  2. Add monitoring after initial deployment
  3. Implement comprehensive monitoring from day one
- **Reasoning**: Comprehensive monitoring from day one provides valuable data from the start and helps identify and address issues quickly.
- **Implications**: This approach requires additional implementation work before deployment but provides significant benefits in terms of visibility and issue resolution.

### March 22, 2025

#### Decision: Implement Geolocation Features with Caching
- **Decision**: Implement geolocation features with robust caching to minimize API calls and improve performance.
- **Context**: Geolocation features require API calls that can be slow and costly if made frequently.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Make API calls on demand without caching
  2. Use a third-party geolocation service
  3. Implement custom caching solution
- **Reasoning**: A custom caching solution provides the best balance of performance and control, allowing us to minimize API calls while still providing accurate location data.
- **Implications**: This approach improves performance and reduces API costs but requires implementing and maintaining a caching system.

#### Decision: Use AsyncStorage for Geolocation Caching
- **Decision**: Use AsyncStorage for caching geolocation data on mobile devices.
- **Context**: Mobile devices need to cache location data to minimize API calls and provide offline functionality.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Use SQLite for structured storage
  2. Use Redux persistence
  3. Use AsyncStorage for simple key-value storage
- **Reasoning**: AsyncStorage provides a simple, reliable solution for caching location data that works well for our needs without adding complexity.
- **Implications**: This approach is simpler to implement but may not scale as well for very large datasets compared to SQLite.

#### Decision: Implement Betting Analytics with Chart Visualization
- **Decision**: Implement betting analytics with interactive charts for data visualization.
- **Context**: Users need to visualize their betting performance to gain insights and make better decisions.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Use text-based summaries only
  2. Use simple static charts
  3. Use interactive charts with filtering
- **Reasoning**: Interactive charts provide the best user experience and allow users to explore their data in different ways.
- **Implications**: This approach enhances the user experience but requires implementing and maintaining chart components.

#### Decision: Add Sharing Functionality to Betting Analytics
- **Decision**: Add the ability to share betting analytics summaries with others.
- **Context**: Users often want to share their betting performance with friends or on social media.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. No sharing functionality
  2. Screenshot-based sharing only
  3. Formatted text sharing with statistics
- **Reasoning**: Formatted text sharing provides a clean, consistent way to share betting performance without privacy concerns of screenshots.
- **Implications**: This approach enhances social engagement but requires implementing sharing functionality and ensuring privacy.
