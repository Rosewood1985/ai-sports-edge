  2. Store assignments in memory only
  3. Store assignments in AsyncStorage
- **Reasoning**: AsyncStorage provides persistent storage that works across sessions, ensuring consistent user experience and valid experiment results.
- **Implications**: This approach requires additional storage operations but provides better user experience and more reliable experiment data.

### March 21, 2025 - Personalization Options Implementation

#### Decision: Create a Dedicated Personalization Service
- **Decision**: Implement a centralized personalization service for managing user preferences.
- **Context**: Users need to customize their experience with default sports, sportsbooks, and other preferences.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Store preferences in component state
  2. Use a general settings service
  3. Create a dedicated personalization service
- **Reasoning**: A dedicated service provides centralized management of preferences, consistent application across the app, and better organization of code.
- **Implications**: This approach requires additional implementation work but provides significant benefits in terms of user experience and code organization.

#### Decision: Use React Context for Personalization
- **Decision**: Create a React context for providing personalization features throughout the app.
- **Context**: Many components need access to personalization features, but passing props would be cumbersome.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Pass preferences as props
  2. Use Redux for state management
  3. Use React Context
- **Reasoning**: React Context provides a clean, React-native way to share personalization features without prop drilling or adding a complex state management library.
- **Implications**: This approach adds some context providers to the component tree but makes it much easier to access personalization features in components.

#### Decision: Implement Default Sport and Sportsbook Selection
- **Decision**: Allow users to set default sports and sportsbooks for a personalized experience.
- **Context**: Users often have preferred sports and sportsbooks that they want to see by default.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Use most recently selected options
  2. Use popularity-based defaults
  3. Allow explicit user selection
- **Reasoning**: Explicit user selection provides the most personalized experience and respects user preferences.
- **Implications**: This approach requires implementing preference selection UI but provides a better user experience.
- **Context**: Animations can cause performance issues, especially on lower-end devices.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Use JavaScript-driven animations
  2. Use CSS animations (web only)
  3. Use native-driven animations
- **Reasoning**: Native-driven animations run on the native UI thread, providing better performance and smoother animations, especially on mobile devices.
- **Implications**: This approach limits the properties that can be animated (only transform and opacity) but provides significant performance benefits.
