# Decision Log

## 2025-05-24: Reporting System Implementation Decisions

### Decision 1: Asynchronous Processing Architecture

**Context:** The reporting system needs to handle potentially long-running tasks like report generation and data export.

**Decision:** Implement an asynchronous processing architecture with a job queue system.

**Rationale:**

- Report generation can be time-consuming, especially for large datasets
- Asynchronous processing allows users to continue using the application while reports are being generated
- Job queue system provides visibility into the status of long-running tasks
- Enables prioritization of tasks based on importance

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Synchronous processing: Rejected due to potential for UI blocking during long operations
- WebWorkers: Rejected due to complexity and browser compatibility concerns
- Server-side only processing: Rejected due to need for real-time progress updates

### Decision 2: Atomic Design Pattern

**Context:** The reporting system requires a consistent and maintainable UI component structure.

**Decision:** Implement the reporting system UI components following the atomic design pattern.

**Rationale:**

- Promotes component reusability and consistency
- Provides a clear mental model for component organization
- Aligns with the existing application architecture
- Facilitates easier maintenance and extension

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Feature-based organization: Rejected due to potential for component duplication
- Page-based organization: Rejected due to limited reusability
- No formal pattern: Rejected due to potential for inconsistency

### Decision 3: Mock Implementation First

**Context:** The backend APIs for the reporting system are not yet available.

**Decision:** Implement the frontend components with mock data and services first.

**Rationale:**

- Allows frontend development to proceed independently of backend development
- Provides a clear contract for what the backend APIs should provide
- Enables early testing and validation of the UI components
- Simplifies the transition to real APIs later

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Wait for backend APIs: Rejected due to development timeline constraints
- Simplified implementation: Rejected due to potential for rework later

### Decision 4: Material UI Integration

**Context:** The reporting system requires a consistent and accessible UI.

**Decision:** Use Material UI components for the reporting system UI.

**Rationale:**

- Provides a comprehensive set of accessible UI components
- Consistent with the existing application design
- Reduces development time through pre-built components
- Offers good customization options for theming

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Custom components: Rejected due to development time constraints
- Other UI libraries: Rejected due to potential inconsistency with existing UI

### Decision 5: TypeScript for Type Safety

**Context:** The reporting system involves complex data structures and component props.

**Decision:** Use TypeScript for all reporting system components and services.

**Rationale:**

- Provides compile-time type checking for complex data structures
- Improves code quality and reduces runtime errors
- Enhances developer experience with better autocomplete and documentation
- Facilitates easier maintenance and refactoring

**Alternatives Considered:**

- JavaScript with PropTypes: Rejected due to limited type checking capabilities
- JavaScript with JSDoc: Rejected due to verbosity and limited IDE support
