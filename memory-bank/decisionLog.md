# Decision Log

## Dependency Update Implementation (May 20, 2025)

### Decision: Implement Dependency Management System

**Context:**

- The project had outdated dependencies that needed to be updated
- There was no standardized process for updating dependencies
- Security vulnerabilities needed to be addressed
- The update process needed to be documented

**Decision:**

- Implement a comprehensive dependency management system
- Create documentation for the dependency update process
- Create scripts to automate the dependency update process
- Establish a regular schedule for dependency updates

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. **Manual Updates**: Manually update dependencies as needed
   - Pros: Simple, no additional tooling required
   - Cons: Error-prone, inconsistent, no documentation
2. **Third-Party Tools**: Use tools like Dependabot or Renovate
   - Pros: Automated, well-maintained
   - Cons: External dependency, less control, potential security concerns
3. **Custom Solution**: Create a custom dependency management system
   - Pros: Full control, tailored to project needs, integrated with existing workflows
   - Cons: Requires development and maintenance

**Rationale:**

- A custom solution provides the most control and can be tailored to the project's specific needs
- The existing update-dependencies.js script provided a good foundation
- Documentation ensures consistency and knowledge transfer
- Automation reduces the risk of errors and ensures regular updates

**Implementation:**

- Enhanced the existing update-dependencies.js script
- Created a new run-dependency-update.sh script to automate the process
- Created comprehensive documentation in docs/implementation-guides/dependency-management.md
- Updated the memory bank with dependency update progress and decisions

**Consequences:**

- Positive: More consistent and reliable dependency updates
- Positive: Better security through regular updates
- Positive: Reduced risk of breaking changes
- Positive: Better documentation and knowledge transfer
- Negative: Additional maintenance overhead for the custom solution

## Firebase Firestore Backup System Implementation (May 20, 2025)

### Decision: Implement Firebase Firestore Backup System

**Context:**

- Firebase Firestore is used as the primary database for the application
- There was no automated backup system in place
- Data loss would be catastrophic for the business
- Manual backups were inconsistent and error-prone

**Decision:**

- Implement an automated backup system for Firebase Firestore
- Use Cloud Functions for scheduled backups
- Store backups in Google Cloud Storage
- Implement a retention policy for backups

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. **Manual Backups**: Manually export data from Firebase console
   - Pros: Simple, no additional development required
   - Cons: Error-prone, inconsistent, requires manual intervention
2. **Third-Party Service**: Use a third-party backup service
   - Pros: Managed solution, less development required
   - Cons: Additional cost, potential security concerns, less control
3. **Custom Solution**: Develop a custom backup system
   - Pros: Full control, tailored to project needs, integrated with existing workflows
   - Cons: Requires development and maintenance

**Rationale:**

- A custom solution provides the most control and can be tailored to the project's specific needs
- Cloud Functions provide a reliable and scalable way to schedule backups
- Google Cloud Storage is a cost-effective and secure storage solution
- A retention policy ensures that storage costs don't grow unbounded

**Implementation:**

- Created atomic components for backup configuration and utilities
- Created molecular components for export, storage, and monitoring
- Created organism component for integrated backup service
- Implemented Cloud Functions for scheduled and manual backups
- Added comprehensive documentation

**Consequences:**

- Positive: Automated, reliable backups
- Positive: Reduced risk of data loss
- Positive: Better disaster recovery capabilities
- Positive: Improved compliance with data protection regulations
- Negative: Additional cost for Google Cloud Storage
- Negative: Additional complexity in the codebase
