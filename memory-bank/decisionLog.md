# Decision Log

## Security Enhancements for Weather Integration

### March 22, 2025

#### Decision: Implement Comprehensive Input Validation in Weather Services
- **Decision**: Add thorough input validation to all weather-related services to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Context**: The initial implementation of weather integration services lacked proper input validation, which could lead to security issues.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Minimal validation at service boundaries only
  2. Comprehensive validation at all levels
  3. Rely on TypeScript type checking alone
- **Reasoning**: Comprehensive validation at all levels provides the most robust security, as it prevents invalid data from propagating through the system and potentially causing unexpected behavior.
- **Implications**: This approach adds some overhead but significantly improves security and reliability of the weather integration services.

#### Decision: Implement Data Sanitization for Weather API Responses
- **Decision**: Sanitize all data returned from weather APIs before using it in the application.
- **Context**: Weather data comes from external APIs and could potentially contain malicious or unexpected values.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Trust the external API data
  2. Sanitize only certain fields
  3. Sanitize all data with strict type checking
- **Reasoning**: Complete sanitization ensures that only expected data formats are processed, preventing injection attacks and unexpected behavior.
- **Implications**: This approach adds processing overhead but ensures that the application only works with clean, validated data.

#### Decision: Add Bounds Checking for Adjustment Factors
- **Decision**: Implement min/max bounds for all weather adjustment factors to prevent extreme values.
- **Context**: Without bounds checking, extreme weather conditions could lead to unreasonable adjustment factors.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. No bounds checking
  2. Loose bounds (e.g., 0.1 to 10.0)
  3. Tight, sport-specific bounds
- **Reasoning**: Sport-specific bounds provide the most accurate and secure approach, as different sports have different sensitivities to weather conditions.
- **Implications**: This prevents extreme odds adjustments that could be exploited by users or cause financial impact.
