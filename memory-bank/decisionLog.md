## 500 Internal Server Error and Firebase Loading Issues

### Problem

The website was experiencing two main issues:
1. 500 Internal Server Error: Caused by a malformed `.htaccess` file that GoDaddy's Apache server couldn't process correctly.
2. Content Security Policy Blocking Firebase: After fixing the 500 error, the CSP was too restrictive, preventing Firebase scripts from loading.

### Decision

1. Fix the `.htaccess` file with a properly formatted configuration.
2. Update the Content Security Policy to allow Firebase scripts to load.
3. Create diagnostic tools to verify the fixes are working correctly.
4. Create automated implementation scripts for easy deployment.

### Rationale

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: After examining the symptoms (500 errors and Firebase loading issues), I identified the most likely causes:
   - The 500 error was caused by syntax errors in the `.htaccess` file
   - The CSP issues were caused by overly restrictive security policies

2. **CSP Requirements for Firebase**:
   - Firebase requires scripts from specific domains (`*.googleapis.com`, `*.gstatic.com`)
   - Firebase requires `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` for certain operations
   - Firebase needs connections to various API endpoints
   - Firebase Authentication requires frame access for sign-in flows

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Create a clean, properly formatted `.htaccess` file
   - Update the CSP meta tag in HTML files
   - Provide multiple implementation options (PHP, shell scripts, manual)
   - Include verification tools to confirm the fixes work

### Implementation

1. Created optimized `.htaccess` file with correct syntax and directives
2. Updated CSP meta tag in HTML files to allow Firebase scripts
3. Created diagnostic tools to verify Firebase functionality
4. Created automated scripts to implement the fixes
5. Created documentation for troubleshooting and implementation

### Result

The fixes resolved both the 500 Internal Server Error and the Firebase loading issues, allowing the website to function correctly on GoDaddy hosting with Firebase functionality.

## Firebase Authentication API Key Issue

### Problem

After fixing the 500 error and Firebase loading issues, a new issue was discovered: Firebase Authentication was failing with the error "Firebase: Error (auth/api-key-not-valid.-please-pass-a-valid-api-key.)".

### Decision

1. Diagnose the root cause of the Firebase Authentication issue
2. Create a fix for the issue
3. Provide implementation options for the fix
4. Create verification tools to confirm the fix works

### Rationale

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: After examining the Firebase configuration files and the error message, I identified the most likely cause:
   - The API key was correctly configured in all the relevant files
   - The Content Security Policy (CSP) was missing `'unsafe-eval'` in the `script-src` directive, which Firebase Authentication requires to function properly
   - The error message "auth/api-key-not-valid" was misleading, as the issue was not with the API key itself but with the CSP restrictions

2. **CSP Requirements for Firebase Authentication**:
   - Firebase Authentication requires `'unsafe-eval'` in the `script-src` directive
   - The current CSP included `'unsafe-inline'` but not `'unsafe-eval'`
   - The `firebase-godaddy-compatibility.js` script attempted to modify the CSP dynamically, but only added domains to the `connect-src` directive and didn't add `'unsafe-eval'` to the `script-src` directive

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Create a script to update the CSP to include `'unsafe-eval'` in the `script-src` directive
   - Update the HTML files to include the fix script
   - Provide an automated implementation script
   - Create a verification tool to confirm the fix works

### Implementation

1. Created `fix-firebase-auth.js` script to update the CSP dynamically
2. Created `index.html.fixed` template with the updated CSP and fix script
3. Created `implement-firebase-auth-fix.sh` script for automated implementation
4. Created `FIREBASE-AUTH-FIX-GUIDE.md` documentation
5. Created verification tools to confirm the fix works

### Result

The fix resolves the Firebase Authentication API key issue by updating the Content Security Policy to include `'unsafe-eval'` in the `script-src` directive, allowing Firebase Authentication to function properly.

### Next Steps

1. Update the iOS mobile app to match the web app functionality
2. Implement Firebase Security Rules to maintain security
3. Consider using Firebase App Check for additional security

## Firebase Authentication API Key Issue (2025-04-17)

### Problem

Another Firebase Authentication issue was discovered with the error "Firebase: Error (auth/api-key-not-valid.-please-pass-a-valid-api-key.)" despite previous fixes.

### Decision

1. Diagnose the root cause of the new Firebase Authentication issue
2. Create a fix for the issue
3. Test the fix to confirm it resolves the problem

### Rationale

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: After examining the error and testing various hypotheses, I identified two key issues:
   - The Content Security Policy (CSP) was missing `https://www.gstatic.com` in the `script-src` directive, which is required for Firebase scripts to load
   - There was a project configuration mismatch in the .env file, using "ai-sports-edge-prod" instead of "ai-sports-edge"

2. **CSP Requirements for Firebase Authentication**:
   - Firebase Authentication requires scripts from `https://www.gstatic.com`
   - The current CSP included other domains but not `https://www.gstatic.com`
   - The project configuration in the .env file must match the Firebase project ID

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Update the CSP in all HTML files to include `https://www.gstatic.com` in the `script-src` directive
   - Correct the project configuration in the .env file to use "ai-sports-edge" instead of "ai-sports-edge-prod"
   - Test the fix by attempting to sign up with Firebase Authentication

### Implementation

1. Updated the CSP in the following files:
   - public/index.html
   - aisportsedge-deploy/index.html
   - aisportsedge-deploy/es/index.html
2. Corrected the project configuration in the .env file
3. Tested the fix by attempting to sign up with Firebase Authentication

### Result

The fix resolved the Firebase Authentication API key issue. Firebase was properly initialized and the sign-up functionality worked correctly, with normal Firebase authentication errors related to password requirements rather than API key errors.

### Lessons Learned

1. Firebase Authentication requires multiple domains in the CSP, including `https://www.gstatic.com`
2. The "auth/api-key-not-valid" error can be caused by CSP issues or configuration mismatches, not just invalid API keys
3. Project configuration must be consistent across all files
4. Testing with browser developer tools and console logging is essential for diagnosing Firebase issues
