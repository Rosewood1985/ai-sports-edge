# Decision Log

This document records implementation decisions and their rationale for the AI Sports Edge app.

## Voice Control Implementation (May 22, 2025)

### Decision: Implement Voice Control in AccessibilityService

**Context:**
The app needed to provide alternative input methods for users with mobility impairments or those who prefer voice interaction. Voice control was identified as a key accessibility feature to complement keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

**Options Considered:**

1. Create a separate VoiceControlService
2. Extend the existing AccessibilityService
3. Implement voice control directly in components

**Decision:**
Extend the existing AccessibilityService to include voice control functionality.

**Rationale:**

- Voice control is fundamentally an accessibility feature and belongs with other accessibility features
- Reuses existing preference management and event notification systems
- Maintains a single source of truth for accessibility features
- Simplifies integration with existing components
- Follows the established pattern of centralizing accessibility features

### Decision: Use Command Registration Pattern

**Context:**
We needed a way for components to register voice commands that could be recognized and executed.

**Options Considered:**

1. Global command registry with static commands
2. Component-based command registration
3. Context-based command system

**Decision:**
Implement a component-based command registration system using the VoiceCommandHandler interface.

**Rationale:**

- Components know best what commands they need to support
- Allows for dynamic command registration based on component lifecycle
- Supports context-specific commands (commands only available in certain screens)
- Follows React's component-based architecture
- Makes it easy to add new commands without modifying central code

### Decision: Placeholder Voice Recognition Implementation

**Context:**
We needed to implement voice recognition but didn't want to commit to a specific library yet.

**Options Considered:**

1. Fully implement with react-native-voice
2. Create a placeholder implementation
3. Mock the functionality entirely

**Decision:**
Create a placeholder implementation that can be replaced with a real voice recognition library.

**Rationale:**

- Allows for testing the command handling system without committing to a specific voice recognition library
- Provides a clear interface for future implementation
- Enables development of voice command handling without waiting for voice recognition implementation
- Makes it easy to swap in different voice recognition libraries in the future
- Follows the dependency inversion principle

### Decision: Enhance AccessibleTouchableOpacity with Keyboard Navigation

**Context:**
We needed to improve keyboard navigation to work alongside voice control.

**Options Considered:**

1. Create a new KeyboardNavigableComponent
2. Enhance existing AccessibleTouchableOpacity
3. Implement keyboard navigation directly in screens

**Decision:**
Enhance the existing AccessibleTouchableOpacity component with keyboard navigation properties.

**Rationale:**

- AccessibleTouchableOpacity is already used throughout the app
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- Follows the principle of progressive enhancement
- Centralizes accessibility features in a single component
- Simplifies integration with AccessibilityService

### Decision: Refactor PaymentScreen as Example Implementation

**Context:**
We needed to demonstrate how to implement voice control and keyboard navigation in a real screen.

**Options Considered:**

1. Create a new demo screen
2. Refactor an existing screen
3. Create documentation without implementation

**Decision:**
Refactor the PaymentScreen with accessibility features including voice control and keyboard navigation.

**Rationale:**

- PaymentScreen is a critical user flow that benefits from accessibility improvements
- Contains various UI elements (text, buttons, form fields) that demonstrate different accessibility needs
- Provides a real-world example of how to implement accessibility features
- Improves the actual app rather than creating demo code
- Serves as a template for refactoring other screens

## Dependency Management Implementation (May 22, 2025)

### Decision: Create Dedicated Dependency Audit Script

**Context:**
The project had numerous dependency issues causing build failures, test failures, and security vulnerabilities. We needed a systematic way to identify and address these issues.

**Options Considered:**

1. Use existing tools like npm audit and npm outdated
2. Create a custom script for comprehensive dependency analysis
3. Manually review and fix dependencies as issues arise

**Decision:**
Create a custom dependency audit script (scripts/dependency-audit.js) that provides comprehensive analysis of dependencies.

**Rationale:**

- Existing tools don't provide a complete picture of dependency issues
- Custom script can be tailored to the specific needs of the project
- Allows for detection of ecosystem-specific conflicts (React, testing libraries, etc.)
- Provides a consistent approach to dependency management
- Can be integrated into CI/CD pipeline for automated checks

### Decision: Fix React Test Renderer Version Mismatch

**Context:**
Tests were failing due to a version mismatch between React and react-test-renderer.

**Options Considered:**

1. Downgrade React to match react-test-renderer
2. Upgrade react-test-renderer to match React
3. Create a workaround for the version mismatch

**Decision:**
Create a targeted fix script (scripts/fix-react-test-renderer.js) to align the versions of React and react-test-renderer.

**Rationale:**

- Version alignment is critical for proper test functioning
- Upgrading react-test-renderer is less disruptive than downgrading React
- Script can be reused whenever dependencies are updated
- Provides a systematic approach to fixing a common issue
- Avoids manual intervention each time dependencies change

### Decision: Create Comprehensive Dependency Management Documentation

**Context:**
The team needed guidance on how to manage dependencies effectively.

**Options Considered:**

1. Rely on external documentation
2. Create minimal documentation focused on specific issues
3. Create comprehensive documentation covering all aspects of dependency management

**Decision:**
Create comprehensive dependency management documentation (memory-bank/dependency-management.md).

**Rationale:**

- Project-specific documentation is more relevant than generic external docs
- Comprehensive documentation provides a single source of truth
- Covers common issues, best practices, and troubleshooting
- Establishes a consistent workflow for dependency management
- Reduces the learning curve for new team members

## Accessibility Testing Implementation (May 21, 2025)

### Decision: Use jest-axe for Automated Accessibility Testing

**Context:**
We needed a way to automatically test components for accessibility violations.

**Options Considered:**

1. Manual testing only
2. Use jest-axe for automated testing
3. Create custom accessibility testing framework

**Decision:**
Implement jest-axe for automated accessibility testing.

**Rationale:**

- Automated testing catches common accessibility issues early
- jest-axe is well-maintained and widely used
- Integrates well with the existing Jest testing framework
- Provides clear violation reports with remediation advice
- Can be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline

### Decision: Create Custom Accessibility Testing Framework

**Context:**
jest-axe alone wasn't sufficient for testing all accessibility aspects, especially in React Native.

**Options Considered:**

1. Rely solely on jest-axe
2. Use multiple testing libraries
3. Create a custom framework that extends jest-axe

**Decision:**
Create a custom accessibility testing framework that extends jest-axe.

**Rationale:**

- React Native has specific accessibility considerations not covered by jest-axe
- Custom framework can integrate multiple testing approaches
- Allows for testing of React Native specific accessibility features
- Can be tailored to the specific needs of the project
- Provides a consistent approach to accessibility testing
