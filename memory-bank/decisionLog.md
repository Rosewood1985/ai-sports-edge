# Decision Log

## Stripe Integration Testing Implementation

### March 20, 2025

#### Decision: Use Jest Mocks Instead of Actual API Calls
- **Decision**: Implement tests using Jest mocks rather than making actual API calls to Stripe.
- **Context**: Testing payment processing requires interaction with Stripe's API, which would create real charges and subscriptions if not mocked.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Use Stripe's test mode with test API keys
  2. Create a mock Stripe server
  3. Use Jest mocks to simulate Stripe API responses
- **Reasoning**: Jest mocks provide the most isolated and consistent testing environment without requiring external dependencies or risking accidental charges.
- **Implications**: Tests will be faster and more reliable, but won't catch issues with the actual Stripe API integration. Additional integration tests with Stripe's test environment may be needed in the future.

#### Decision: Organize Tests by Functional Area
- **Decision**: Organize tests by functional area (configuration, subscriptions, purchases, webhooks, security) rather than by component.
- **Context**: Stripe integration spans multiple components and services in the application.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Organize tests by component (one test file per component)
  2. Organize tests by user flow (one test file per user flow)
  3. Organize tests by functional area (one test file per functional area)
- **Reasoning**: Functional area organization provides better coverage of specific aspects of the Stripe integration and makes it easier to ensure comprehensive testing of each area.
- **Implications**: This organization makes it clear what functionality is being tested, but may result in some overlap between test files.

#### Decision: Implement a Shell Script for Test Orchestration
- **Decision**: Create a shell script to run all Stripe tests and generate coverage reports.
- **Context**: Running multiple test files individually is cumbersome and doesn't provide a comprehensive view of test coverage.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Use Jest's built-in test discovery
  2. Create a JavaScript test runner
  3. Create a shell script for test orchestration
- **Reasoning**: A shell script provides the most flexibility for running tests in a specific order, with custom output formatting, and generating coverage reports.
- **Implications**: The script is platform-specific (Unix/Linux/macOS) and may need to be adapted for Windows environments.

#### Decision: Include Security-Specific Tests
- **Decision**: Create a dedicated test file for security aspects of the Stripe integration.
- **Context**: Payment processing requires strict security measures to protect sensitive information.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Include security tests in each functional area test file
  2. Create a separate security test file
  3. Rely on manual security testing
- **Reasoning**: A dedicated security test file ensures that security concerns are explicitly addressed and not overlooked.
- **Implications**: This approach highlights the importance of security in payment processing and provides a clear checklist of security measures that must be implemented.

#### Decision: Mock File System for Security Tests
- **Decision**: Use mocks for file system operations in security tests rather than reading actual files.
- **Context**: Security tests need to verify that certain patterns exist in the codebase without being affected by changes to the actual files.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Read actual files during tests
  2. Use static strings for expected patterns
  3. Mock file system operations
- **Reasoning**: Mocking file system operations provides a consistent testing environment and allows tests to run without depending on the actual file contents.
- **Implications**: Tests may not catch issues if the mock content doesn't accurately reflect the actual file content. The mocks will need to be updated if the file content changes significantly.
