# Legal Screen Update Documentation

**Date:** May 19, 2025  
**Author:** Roo  
**Component:** LegalScreen.tsx

## Overview

This document records the updates made to the LegalScreen.tsx component, which displays the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service content in the AI Sports Edge application.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Privacy Policy Content**

   - Replaced placeholder privacy policy with a comprehensive, well-structured policy
   - Added detailed sections covering data collection, usage, sharing, and user rights
   - Organized content with clear headings and formatting for better readability on mobile devices
   - Updated effective date to May 18, 2025

2. **Updated Terms of Service Content**

   - Replaced placeholder terms with comprehensive terms of service
   - Added detailed sections covering eligibility, account responsibilities, subscriptions, user content, intellectual property, disclaimers, liability limitations, and dispute resolution
   - Organized content with clear headings and formatting for better readability on mobile devices
   - Updated effective date to May 18, 2025

3. **Fixed Import Path**
   - Corrected the import path for the LanguageContext from `../../atomic/organisms/i18n/LanguageContext` to `../contexts/LanguageContext`
   - This resolved a TypeScript error that was preventing the component from compiling

## Implementation Details

The updated legal content follows best practices for mobile applications:

1. **Accessibility Considerations**

   - Content is structured with proper headings and sections for screen readers
   - Text is formatted for readability with appropriate spacing and organization

2. **Mobile-Friendly Design**

   - Content is formatted to be easily readable on mobile screens
   - Sections are clearly delineated for easy navigation

3. **Legal Compliance**
   - Privacy Policy includes all necessary disclosures about data collection, usage, and user rights
   - Terms of Service covers all essential legal protections for the application

## Future Considerations

1. **Localization**

   - Consider translating legal content to Spanish to align with the app's language support
   - Ensure translations maintain legal accuracy and intent

2. **Content Updates**

   - Legal content should be reviewed periodically to ensure compliance with changing regulations
   - Consider implementing a version tracking system for legal documents

3. **Loading Optimization**
   - In the future, consider loading legal content from external files or an API as mentioned in the original code comment
   - This would improve maintainability and allow for updates without code changes
