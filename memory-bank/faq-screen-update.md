# FAQ Screen Update Documentation

**Date:** May 19, 2025  
**Author:** Roo  
**Component:** FAQScreen.tsx

## Overview

This document records the updates made to the FAQScreen.tsx component to add a new "Legal & Compliance" category with FAQ items related to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Legal & Compliance FAQ Items**

   - Added a new `legalFaqItems` array with 5 FAQ items related to legal and compliance topics:
     - "How is my personal data used?"
     - "Can I request deletion of my data?"
     - "What are the terms for using AI Sports Edge?"
     - "How do I report terms violations?"
     - "What is your refund policy?"
   - Each answer includes references to either the Privacy Policy or Terms of Service documents

2. **Added Interactive Links to Legal Documents**

   - Implemented a `renderAnswerWithLinks` function that parses FAQ answers and converts references to "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service" into clickable links
   - These links navigate to the LegalScreen with the appropriate parameter ('privacy-policy' or 'terms-of-service')
   - Added proper accessibility attributes to ensure the links are accessible to screen readers

3. **Fixed TypeScript Type Issues**

   - Updated the import for the language context from `useI18n` to `useLanguage`
   - Added proper typing for the navigation object and navigation parameters
   - Added type annotations for arrays in the link rendering function

4. **Integrated with Existing Categories**

   - Added the new legal FAQ items to the `allFaqItems` array, placing them after the existing categories but before user-submitted questions
   - Maintained the existing UI style and accessibility features

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows best practices for accessibility and user experience:

1. **Accessibility Considerations**

   - All links have proper accessibility attributes including roles, labels, and hints
   - The existing accessibility structure for FAQ items was preserved

2. **User Experience**

   - Legal information is presented in a clear, question-and-answer format consistent with other FAQ categories
   - Links to legal documents are visually distinct and interactive

3. **Code Organization**
   - The new FAQ category follows the same pattern as existing categories
   - The link rendering function is implemented efficiently to handle both Privacy Policy and Terms of Service references

## Related Components

- **LegalScreen.tsx** - Displays the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service content
- **LanguageContext.tsx** - Provides translation functionality used in the FAQ screen

## Future Considerations

1. **Localization**

   - The new FAQ items should be added to the translation files for proper localization
   - Consider translating the legal content to Spanish to align with the app's language support

2. **Content Updates**

   - Legal FAQ content should be reviewed periodically to ensure it remains accurate and up-to-date
   - Consider adding more FAQ items related to legal topics as needed

3. **User Feedback**
   - Monitor user engagement with the legal FAQ items to determine if additional items or clarifications are needed
