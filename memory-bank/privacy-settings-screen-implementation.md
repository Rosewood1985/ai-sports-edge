# Privacy Settings Screen Implementation

## Overview

Updated the PrivacySettingsScreen component to use the new privacyService instead of directly using the privacy molecules. This change improves the code organization by following the atomic architecture pattern and makes the privacy features more maintainable by centralizing the privacy-related functionality in the privacyService.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

The PrivacySettingsScreen component is now structured as follows:

1. **Screen Wrapper**: `screens/PrivacySettingsScreen.tsx` - A simple wrapper that provides the SafeAreaView and imports the main component from the atomic architecture.
2. **Main Component**: `atomic/organisms/privacy/PrivacySettingsScreen.tsx` - The main component that implements the privacy settings UI and functionality.
3. **Service Integration**: The component now uses the `privacyService` from `atomic/organisms/privacy` instead of directly using the privacy molecules.

### Key Changes

1. **Updated Imports**:

   - Changed imports to use the privacyService from the atomic/organisms/privacy directory
   - Updated screens/PrivacySettingsScreen.tsx to import from the atomic/organisms/privacy directory

2. **Updated Request Handlers**:

   - Modified data access request handler to use privacyService.requestDataAccess
   - Modified data deletion request handler to use privacyService.requestDataDeletion
   - Modified account deletion request handler to use privacyService.requestAccountDeletion

3. **Updated Data Loading**:

   - Updated the refresh logic to load both access and deletion requests
   - Used privacyService.getUserDataAccessRequests and privacyService.getUserDataDeletionRequests

4. **Export Updates**:
   - Added PrivacySettingsScreen export to atomic/organisms/privacy/index.ts
   - Added privacyService export to atomic/organisms/index.js

### UI Features

The PrivacySettingsScreen component provides the following features:

1. **Privacy Preferences Management**:

   - Toggle switches for marketing communications, data analytics, third-party sharing, and profiling
   - Save button to update preferences

2. **Data Request Management**:

   - Request data access button
   - Request data deletion button
   - List of existing requests with status indicators

3. **Privacy Information**:
   - Links to privacy policy and terms of service

## Technical Decisions

1. **Service-Based Architecture**: Used the privacyService as a central point for all privacy-related functionality, following the service-based architecture pattern.

2. **Atomic Architecture**: Followed the atomic architecture pattern by organizing the code into atoms, molecules, and organisms.

3. **Refresh Pattern**: Implemented a refresh pattern for the requests list, where after creating a new request, the component fetches the updated list from the service.

4. **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for all service calls, with user-friendly error messages.

## Future Improvements

1. **Pagination**: Add pagination for the requests list to handle a large number of requests.

2. **Request Details**: Add a detailed view for each request to show more information.

3. **Request Cancellation**: Add the ability to cancel pending requests.

4. **Request Filtering**: Add filtering options for the requests list.

5. **Accessibility**: Enhance accessibility features for the privacy settings screen.
