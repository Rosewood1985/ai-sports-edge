# Accessibility Testing Implementation Status

## Current Status

We've made progress in setting up a custom accessibility testing framework for the AI Sports Edge app, but there are several critical issues that need to be addressed before it can be fully implemented.

### Completed Work

1. **Basic Testing Infrastructure**

   - Created `jest-setup-accessibility.js` with initial setup for React Native testing
   - Implemented `axe-react-native.ts` adapter to bridge jest-axe with React Native components
   - Created a simple test case (`SimpleAccessibilityTest.test.tsx`) that demonstrates the concept
   - Added test scripts to package.json for running accessibility tests

2. **Test Runner Script**

   - Modified `scripts/run-accessibility-tests.js` to use our custom setup
   - Added options to disable coverage and run tests in isolation
   - Implemented reporting to `test-results/accessibility-report.json`

3. **Component Testing**
   - Started implementing tests for the AccessibleTouchable component
   - Created test structure with proper accessibility checks

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Missing Dependencies**

   - `@sentry/browser` is imported by errorTrackingService but not installed
   - `@sentry/types` is imported but not installed
   - Several other dependencies have version conflicts

2. **React Navigation Theme Issues**

   - The atomic components use `useTheme` from `@react-navigation/native` but it's not properly configured in the test environment

3. **Component Dependency Chain Problems**

   - AccessibleTouchableOpacity has dependency conflicts
   - Many components have complex dependency chains that break in the test environment

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - npm audit shows 119 vulnerabilities (71 moderate, 44 high, 4 critical)
   - Many outdated packages need updates

## Required Actions

### Immediate Fixes Needed

1. **Dependency Installation**

   - Install missing dependencies:
     ```
     npm install @sentry/browser @sentry/types --save-dev
     ```

2. **Test Environment Configuration**

   - Properly configure React Navigation theme provider in test environment
   - Create proper mocks for Firebase, Sentry, and other services

3. **Component Test Isolation**
   - Refactor tests to isolate components from their dependencies
   - Create proper mocks for dependent services

### Medium-Term Tasks

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**

   - Create accessibility tests for all key UI components
   - Test keyboard navigation functionality
   - Test focus management
   - Test screen reader compatibility

2. **CI/CD Integration**

   - Add accessibility testing to the CI/CD pipeline
   - Create reporting for accessibility compliance
   - Set up automated accessibility checks for PRs

3. **Dependency Updates**
   - Update all outdated dependencies
   - Resolve security vulnerabilities
   - Ensure compatibility between packages

### Long-Term Goals

1. **Automated Accessibility Compliance**

   - Implement automated checks against WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Create visual reports for accessibility compliance
   - Integrate with design system to ensure accessibility by default

2. **Cross-Platform Testing**

   - Extend testing to cover iOS, Android, and Web platforms
   - Test with actual screen readers and assistive technologies
   - Create platform-specific accessibility guidelines

3. **User Testing**
   - Conduct user testing with people who use assistive technologies
   - Gather feedback and implement improvements
   - Create an accessibility roadmap for continuous improvement

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues**

   - Fix dependency issues
   - Update test environment configuration
   - Get basic tests passing

2. **Phase 2: Expand Test Coverage**

   - Create tests for all atomic components
   - Implement comprehensive accessibility checks
   - Document accessibility requirements

3. **Phase 3: Automate and Integrate**
   - Add to CI/CD pipeline
   - Create reporting dashboards
   - Implement automated checks for PRs
