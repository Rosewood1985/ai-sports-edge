# Service Worker Disabled for Performance

**Date:** April 22, 2025
**Task:** Disable service worker for improved performance

## Problem

The service worker was causing performance issues and wasn't being actively used for offline caching or push notifications. Service workers can cause:

- Unnecessary caching of resources
- Background processing that consumes battery
- Stale content being served from cache
- Potential conflicts with Firebase authentication
- Increased complexity in debugging

## Solution

1. **Modified register-service-worker.js**
   - Commented out the service worker registration code
   - Added a console log to indicate service worker is disabled
   - Kept the file to prevent 404 errors from existing clients

2. **Modified service-worker.js**
   - Disabled all service worker functionality
   - Kept a minimal file to prevent 404 errors
   - Added a console log to indicate service worker is disabled

3. **Deployment**
   - Deployed the modified files to the server using SFTP
   - No need to modify index.html since it still includes the register-service-worker.js script, which now does nothing

## Benefits

- **Improved Performance**: Eliminates unnecessary background processing and caching
- **Reduced Battery Usage**: No background sync operations
- **Simplified Debugging**: Easier to debug without service worker interference
- **Fresh Content**: Users always get the latest content without cache issues
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing clients won't get 404 errors

## Implementation Notes

The service worker was previously implementing:
- Caching of static assets
- Offline support for API requests
- Background sync for offline actions
- IndexedDB integration for pending actions

None of these features were being actively used in the application, making the service worker unnecessary overhead.

## Future Considerations

If offline functionality is needed in the future:
1. Re-enable the service worker with a new cache version
2. Implement more targeted caching strategies
3. Consider using Workbox for better service worker management
4. Add proper versioning and update flow
