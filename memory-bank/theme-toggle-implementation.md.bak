# Theme Toggle Implementation

## Overview
Added a ThemeToggle component across all platforms (mobile and web) to allow users to switch between light and dark themes. This implementation ensures a consistent user experience across all parts of the application.

## Changes Made

### Mobile App
1. Added ThemeToggle to all auth screens:
   - `screens/Auth/SignupScreen.tsx`
   - `screens/Auth/LoginScreen.tsx`
   - `screens/Auth/ForgotPasswordScreen.tsx`

2. Added to main navigation:
   - `navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Added to header right in tab navigator

3. Added to settings:
   - `screens/SettingsScreen.tsx` - Replaced dark mode switch with ThemeToggle

### Web App
1. Created theme infrastructure:
   - `web/contexts/ThemeContext.js` - New context with localStorage persistence
   - `web/components/ThemeToggle.js` - New toggle with sun/moon icons
   - `web/styles/ThemeToggle.css` - Styling with hover effects

2. Added ThemeToggle to web components:
   - `web/components/Header.js` - Added to main navigation
   - `web/pages/LoginPage.js` - Added to login form
   - `web/pages/HomePage.js` - Added to CTA section
   - `web/pages/AboutPage.js` - Added to SimpleHeader component

3. Added CSS styles:
   - Updated `web/styles/login.css` with theme toggle styling
   - Updated `web/styles/home.css` with theme toggle styling
   - Updated `web/styles/about.css` with theme toggle styling

4. Integrated with app structure:
   - Updated `web/App.js` to wrap with ThemeProvider
   - Fixed import paths for proper context access

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed import path in App.tsx to correctly reference ThemeContext
- Updated Colors references in App.tsx to match the actual structure in Colors.ts
- Fixed metro.config.js to properly exclude xcode-git-ai-sports-edge directory

## Deployment
- Created deployment script to deploy changes to Firebase hosting
- Successfully deployed to https://aisportsedge.app

## Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback on theme toggle functionality
- Consider adding theme toggle to additional screens as needed
- Ensure theme consistency across all components
