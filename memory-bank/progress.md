## Phase 3: Reporting & Automation Implementation

### 2025-05-24: Asynchronous Processing Architecture Implementation

#### Completed:

1. **Job Queue System**

   - Created `src/types/jobs.ts` with comprehensive type definitions for the job queue system
   - Implemented `JobStatus`, `JobType`, and `JobPriority` enums
   - Defined interfaces for different job types (ReportGenerationJob, ReportExportJob, ReportPreviewJob)

2. **Job Queue Service**

   - Implemented `src/services/jobQueueService.ts` with mock implementation
   - Added methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and canceling jobs
   - Implemented asynchronous job processing simulation

3. **React Hooks**

   - Created `src/hooks/useJobQueue.ts` with hooks for interacting with the job queue
   - Implemented `useJobTracking` for tracking individual jobs
   - Implemented `useJobQueue` for managing multiple jobs
   - Added `useReportGeneration` for report-specific job creation

4. **UI Components**
   - Created `src/components/dashboard/reporting/JobProgressIndicator.tsx` for displaying job progress
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in Material UI Grid components by adding component="div" prop

### 2025-05-24: Reporting System Components Implementation

#### Completed:

1. **Report Types and Interfaces**

   - Created `src/types/reporting.ts` with comprehensive type definitions for the reporting system
   - Implemented interfaces for report templates, scheduled reports, and report history
   - Defined enums for report status, frequency, and format

2. **Atomic Components for Report Scheduling**

   - **Atoms:**
     - Implemented `ScheduleStatusBadge` for displaying schedule status
     - Implemented `FrequencyBadge` for displaying schedule frequency
     - Implemented `RecipientChip` for displaying report recipients
     - Implemented `DateRangePicker` for selecting date ranges
   - **Molecules:**
     - Implemented `ScheduledReportCard` for displaying scheduled reports
   - **Organisms:**
     - Implemented `ScheduledReportsList` for displaying and managing scheduled reports

3. **Atomic Components for Report History**

   - **Atoms:**
     - Implemented `HistoryStatusBadge` for displaying report history status
     - Implemented `FormatBadge` for displaying report format
   - **Molecules:**
     - Implemented `ReportHistoryCard` for displaying report history items
   - **Organisms:**
     - Implemented `ReportHistoryList` for displaying and filtering report history

4. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive README.md for the reporting module
   - Added detailed documentation for all components
   - Included usage examples and component hierarchy

#### In Progress:

1. **Report Template Components**
   - Created `src/components/dashboard/reporting/ReportTemplateForm.tsx` for creating/editing templates
   - Created atomic components for report templates:
     - Atoms: `TemplateStatusBadge`, `WidgetChip`
     - Molecules: `TemplateCard`, `TemplateActions`
     - Organisms: `TemplateList`

#### Next Steps:

1. Implement Report Generation components:

   - GenerationForm
   - GenerationOptions
   - GenerationPreview

2. Connect components to real API endpoints when available

3. Implement comprehensive unit tests for all components

#### Technical Decisions:

1. Used asynchronous processing architecture to handle potentially long-running report generation tasks
2. Implemented job queue with status tracking and progress updates
3. Used React hooks for clean component integration
4. Used Material UI for consistent UI components
5. Followed atomic design principles for component organization
6. Used TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
7. Implemented mock data and services for development before real APIs are available
