#### In Progress

### In Progress

- 🔄 Refactoring additional interactive components to use `AccessibleTouchableOpacity`
- 🔄 Conducting accessibility testing with screen readers

### Pending

- ⏳ Update component documentation to include focus state usage
- ⏳ Add accessibility checks to CI/CD pipeline
