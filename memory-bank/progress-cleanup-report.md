## Summary

The `progress.md` file has been successfully deduplicated, optimized, and restructured to improve readability and maintainability. This report summarizes the changes made and the improvements achieved.

## Changes Made

### 1. Deduplication

### 2. Structural Improvements

- **Added Maintenance Guidelines**: Created a new section with guidelines for maintaining the file structure

### 3. Content Preservation

- **Preserved Original Data**: Kept the original log data in a collapsible `<details>` section for reference
