# Active Context: Dependency Update Implementation

## Current Implementation Focus

We are updating the dependencies for the AI Sports Edge application to ensure they are up-to-date, secure, and compatible with the application. This includes checking for security vulnerabilities, applying necessary updates, and testing the application to ensure everything works correctly.

## Components Implemented

1. **Dependency Update Script**:

   - Verified `scripts/update-dependencies.js` is working correctly
   - Made the script executable
   - Ran the script to check for outdated packages and security vulnerabilities

2. **Documentation**:
   - Created `memory-bank/dependency-update-process.md` to document the update process
   - Documented the update strategy and considerations

## Current Status

- Checking for security vulnerabilities
- Lockfile age is 1 day, which is within the acceptable range (less than 30 days)
- No outdated packages found (or error occurred during check)

## Next Steps

1. **Security Updates**:

   - Apply security-focused updates if vulnerabilities are found
   - Verify that security updates don't break existing functionality

2. **Dependency Updates**:

   - Apply patch and minor updates
   - Test the application thoroughly after updates

3. **Documentation**:

   - Document any breaking changes or required adjustments
   - Update the todo list to mark the dependency update task as completed

4. **Testing**:
   - Run comprehensive tests to ensure the application works correctly with updated dependencies
   - Test on different platforms (iOS, Android, web)

## Considerations

- React Native and Expo compatibility
- Native modules that may require additional configuration
- Breaking changes in major version updates
- Peer dependency issues
