# Active Context: GDPR/CCPA Compliance Implementation

## Current Focus

We are currently focused on implementing GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) compliance for AI Sports Edge. This is a critical pre-launch task that addresses legal requirements for handling user data.

## Key Components

1. **Data Inventory and Mapping**

   - Identifying all personal data collected
   - Documenting data flows and storage locations
   - Determining legal basis for processing

2. **User Rights Implementation**

   - Right to access personal data
   - Right to deletion ("right to be forgotten")
   - Right to data portability
   - Right to restrict processing

3. **Consent Management**

   - Explicit consent collection
   - Consent record storage
   - Consent withdrawal mechanisms

4. **Privacy Dashboard**

   - User interface for exercising privacy rights
   - Privacy preference management
   - Data access and deletion request submission

5. **Documentation and Accountability**
   - Records of processing activities
   - Data protection impact assessments
   - Breach notification procedures

## Implementation Approach

We are following our atomic architecture pattern for this implementation:

- **Atoms**: Basic configuration, types, and utilities
- **Molecules**: Functional components for specific privacy operations
- **Organisms**: Complex components that coordinate privacy functions
- **Templates**: Page layouts for privacy-related screens
- **Pages**: Complete screen implementations

## Timeline

The implementation is planned in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Core Infrastructure (May 21-28, 2025)
2. **Phase 2**: User Rights Implementation (May 29-June 5, 2025)
3. **Phase 3**: Consent Management (June 6-13, 2025)
4. **Phase 4**: User Interface (June 14-21, 2025)
5. **Phase 5**: Testing and Documentation (June 22-29, 2025)

## Next Steps

1. Switch to Code mode to begin implementing the core infrastructure components
2. Create the atomic components for GDPR/CCPA compliance
3. Implement the database schema updates
4. Develop the API endpoints for privacy-related operations
