# Active Implementation Context

## Current Focus: Reporting System Implementation

We are currently implementing a reporting system for the admin dashboard using atomic design principles. The system allows administrators to create, edit, and generate reports based on customizable templates.

### Key Components

1. **Job Queue System**

   - Asynchronous processing architecture for handling long-running tasks
   - Job status tracking and progress updates
   - Priority-based job scheduling

2. **Report Template Management**

   - Template creation and editing
   - Widget selection for report content
   - Filter configuration for data selection

3. **Report Generation**

   - Asynchronous report generation
   - Progress tracking and status updates
   - Download of generated reports

4. **Report Scheduling**

   - Schedule creation and management
   - Frequency configuration (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Recipient management

5. **Report History**
   - History tracking and filtering
   - Status monitoring
   - Download and view options

### Implementation Approach

We're following atomic design principles to create a modular and maintainable system:

- **Atoms**: Basic UI components like badges and chips
- **Molecules**: Composite components like cards and action menus
- **Organisms**: Complex components that combine molecules into functional units
- **Templates**: Page layouts that arrange organisms
- **Pages**: Complete pages with content

### Current Status

- Implemented job queue system with TypeScript interfaces and mock implementation
- Created React hooks for interacting with the job queue
- Implemented atomic components for report template management:
  - Atoms: TemplateStatusBadge, WidgetChip
  - Molecules: TemplateCard, TemplateActions, JobProgressIndicator
  - Organisms: TemplateList, ReportTemplateForm
- Implemented atomic components for report scheduling:
  - Atoms: ScheduleStatusBadge, FrequencyBadge, RecipientChip, DateRangePicker
  - Molecules: ScheduledReportCard
  - Organisms: ScheduledReportsList
- Implemented atomic components for report history:
  - Atoms: HistoryStatusBadge, FormatBadge
  - Molecules: ReportHistoryCard
  - Organisms: ReportHistoryList

### Next Steps

1. Implement Report Generation components:

   - GenerationForm
   - GenerationOptions
   - GenerationPreview

2. Connect components to real API endpoints when available

3. Implement comprehensive unit tests for all components

### Technical Considerations

- Ensure proper error handling for asynchronous operations
- Implement caching for improved performance
- Ensure accessibility of all UI components
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all components
