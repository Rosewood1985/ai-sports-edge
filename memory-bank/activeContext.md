# Active Implementation Context

## Current Focus: Reporting System Implementation

We are currently implementing a reporting system for the admin dashboard using atomic design principles. The system allows administrators to create, edit, and generate reports based on customizable templates.

### Key Components

1. **Job Queue System**

   - Asynchronous processing architecture for handling long-running tasks
   - Job status tracking and progress updates
   - Priority-based job scheduling

2. **Report Template Management**

   - Template creation and editing
   - Widget selection for report content
   - Filter configuration for data selection

3. **Report Generation**
   - Asynchronous report generation
   - Progress tracking and status updates
   - Download of generated reports

### Implementation Approach

We're following atomic design principles to create a modular and maintainable system:

- **Atoms**: Basic UI components like badges and chips
- **Molecules**: Composite components like cards and action menus
- **Organisms**: Complex components that combine molecules into functional units
- **Templates**: Page layouts that arrange organisms
- **Pages**: Complete pages with content

### Current Status

- Implemented job queue system with TypeScript interfaces and mock implementation
- Created React hooks for interacting with the job queue
- Implemented atomic components for report template management:
  - Atoms: TemplateStatusBadge, WidgetChip
  - Molecules: TemplateCard, TemplateActions, JobProgressIndicator
  - Organisms: TemplateList, ReportTemplateForm

### Next Steps

1. Implement ReportScheduling components:

   - ScheduleForm
   - ScheduleList
   - ScheduleActions

2. Implement ReportHistory components:

   - HistoryList
   - HistoryDetails
   - HistoryFilters

3. Connect components to real API endpoints when available

### Technical Considerations

- Ensure proper error handling for asynchronous operations
- Implement caching for improved performance
- Ensure accessibility of all UI components
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all components
