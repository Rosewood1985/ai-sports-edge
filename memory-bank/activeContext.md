# Active Context: Dependency Management Implementation

## Previous Context: Dependency Management Audit Implementation

_Note: This section preserved for historical context_

Implementing a comprehensive dependency management audit to identify and resolve dependency issues in the project. This work is critical for ensuring the stability, security, and maintainability of the codebase.

### Key Activities:

1. **Comprehensive Audit Tasks Addition**

   - Added comprehensive audit tasks to .roo-todo.md
   - Added detailed dependency management audit tasks
   - Updated progress.md to document the changes
   - Preserved existing to-do list structure and content

2. **Dependency Management Audit Implementation**

   - Analyzing package.json and package-lock.json for version conflicts
   - Identifying outdated packages and security vulnerabilities
   - Checking for duplicate dependencies and peer dependency issues
   - Identifying ecosystem-specific conflicts (React, testing libraries, build tools)
   - Searching for broken dependency patterns in the codebase
   - Documenting React Native specific dependency issues

## Current Implementation Focus

Implementing real solutions for dependency management issues in the AI Sports Edge project. This work focuses on creating tools and documentation to systematically address dependency problems rather than creating workarounds.

### Key Activities:

### Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Real Solutions Over Workarounds**: Focus on fixing root causes rather than creating workarounds
2. **Systematic Approach**: Create tools and documentation for consistent dependency management
3. **Targeted Fixes**: Address critical issues first, especially those affecting testing and security
4. **Documentation**: Provide clear guidance for future dependency management
5. **Backup and Safety**: Ensure all changes are backed up and can be reverted if needed

### Next Steps

1. **Execute Fix Scripts**: Run the fix scripts to address critical dependency issues
2. **Test Fixes**: Verify that the fixes resolve the issues without introducing new problems
3. **Update Dependencies**: Systematically update outdated dependencies based on audit results
4. **Security Remediation**: Address security vulnerabilities identified in the audit
5. **Integration with CI/CD**: Add dependency checks to the CI/CD pipeline

### Key Activities:

1. **To-Do List Consolidation**

   - Consolidated multiple to-do lists into a single central .roo-todo.md file
   - Added a note indicating it's the central to-do list
   - Added "Documentation Gaps" section based on documentation audit findings

2. **Codebase Cleanup**

   - Archived deprecated ai-sports-edge-todo.md file to backups/20250522/
   - Committed changes to the repository
   - Updated memory-bank/progress.md with implementation details

3. **Documentation Gap Tracking**
   - Added tasks to update implementation status markers in documentation
   - Added tasks to include "Implementation Gap" subsections in documentation
   - Added tasks to improve documentation with specific file paths and code snippets

## Previous Implementation Focus

Implementing advanced OCR accuracy improvements for bet slip scanning in the AI Sports Edge app, including image preprocessing, multi-provider OCR engine, intelligent bet slip parser, and enhanced OCR service integration.

## Components Created/Modified

1. **imagePreprocessingService.js** (services/imagePreprocessingService.js)

   - Provides advanced image preprocessing techniques to enhance bet slip image quality
   - Includes methods for noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and perspective correction
   - Optimizes images specifically for OCR processing

2. **multiProviderOCRService.js** (services/multiProviderOCRService.js)

   - Integrates with multiple OCR providers (Google Vision, AWS Textract, Azure Computer Vision)
   - Implements consensus-based text recognition for improved accuracy
   - Handles provider selection, API calls, and result aggregation

3. **intelligentBetSlipParser.js** (services/intelligentBetSlipParser.js)

   - Provides sophisticated parsing of OCR results specific to betting slips
   - Includes pattern recognition for different sportsbooks (DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars)
   - Implements contextual analysis and spatial relationship processing
   - Validates consistency and calculates confidence scores

4. **enhancedOCRService.js** (services/enhancedOCRService.js)
   - Orchestrates the complete OCR workflow

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Modular Design**: Each service is designed to handle a specific part of the OCR process, making the system more maintainable and testable.

2. **Consensus-Based Recognition**: Multiple OCR providers are used to improve accuracy through consensus-based text recognition.

3. **Contextual Analysis**: Spatial relationships and betting slip patterns are analyzed to improve parsing accuracy.

4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and reporting is implemented throughout the system.

## Next Steps
