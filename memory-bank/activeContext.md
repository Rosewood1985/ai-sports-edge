# Active Context: Focus States Implementation

## Current Implementation Focus

Implementing proper focus states for all interactive elements in AI Sports Edge to improve accessibility.

## Components Created/Modified

1. **AccessibleTouchableOpacity** (atomic/atoms/AccessibleTouchableOpacity.tsx)

   - Enhanced with internal focus state tracking
   - Added support for animated focus transitions
   - Added proper accessibility attributes

2. **focusStateUtils** (atomic/atoms/focusStateUtils.ts)

   - Created useFocusState hook for managing focus state
   - Added utilities for creating focus styles
   - Added high contrast focus color utilities

3. **LanguageSelector** (atomic/molecules/language/LanguageSelector.tsx)

   - Refactored to use AccessibleTouchableOpacity
   - Added proper accessibility attributes
   - Improved screen reader support

4. **ThemeToggle** (atomic/molecules/theme/ThemeToggle.tsx)

   - Refactored to use AccessibleTouchableOpacity
   - Added proper accessibility attributes
   - Improved screen reader support

5. **Interactive Components** (components/\*.tsx)
   - Refactored to use AccessibleTouchableOpacity
   - Added proper accessibility attributes
   - Improved screen reader support

## Tests and Documentation

1. **AccessibleTouchableOpacity.test.tsx** (**tests**/accessibility/AccessibleTouchableOpacity.test.tsx)

   - Added tests for focus state behavior
   - Added tests for accessibility attributes
   - Added tests for press event handling

2. **focus-states.md** (docs/implementation-guides/focus-states.md)
   - Added documentation for focus state implementation
   - Added usage examples
   - Added best practices

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Atomic Design**: Focus state components are implemented at the atom level and composed into molecules and organisms.

2. **Accessibility First**: All components are designed with accessibility in mind, including proper ARIA attributes and screen reader support.

3. **Customizability**: Focus styles can be customized for different components while maintaining a consistent base style.

4. **Performance**: Focus state animations are optimized for performance using React Native's Animated API.

## Next Steps

1. **Refactor Additional Components**: Continue refactoring other interactive components to use AccessibleTouchableOpacity.

2. **Accessibility Testing**: Conduct thorough accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

3. **Documentation Updates**: Update component documentation to include focus state usage.

4. **CI/CD Integration**: Add accessibility checks to CI/CD pipeline.
