# Active Context: OCR Accuracy Improvements Implementation

## Current Implementation Focus

Implementing advanced OCR accuracy improvements for bet slip scanning in the AI Sports Edge app, including image preprocessing, multi-provider OCR engine, intelligent bet slip parser, and enhanced OCR service integration.

## Components Created/Modified

1. **imagePreprocessingService.js** (services/imagePreprocessingService.js)

   - Provides advanced image preprocessing techniques to enhance bet slip image quality
   - Includes methods for noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and perspective correction
   - Optimizes images specifically for OCR processing

2. **multiProviderOCRService.js** (services/multiProviderOCRService.js)

   - Integrates with multiple OCR providers (Google Vision, AWS Textract, Azure Computer Vision)
   - Implements consensus-based text recognition for improved accuracy
   - Handles provider selection, API calls, and result aggregation

3. **intelligentBetSlipParser.js** (services/intelligentBetSlipParser.js)

   - Provides sophisticated parsing of OCR results specific to betting slips
   - Includes pattern recognition for different sportsbooks (DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars)
   - Implements contextual analysis and spatial relationship processing
   - Validates consistency and calculates confidence scores

4. **enhancedOCRService.js** (services/enhancedOCRService.js)
   - Orchestrates the complete OCR workflow
   - Manages database interactions for OCR uploads
   - Provides metrics and status reporting
   - Handles error cases and cleanup

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Modular Design**: Each service is designed to handle a specific part of the OCR process, making the system more maintainable and testable.

2. **Consensus-Based Recognition**: Multiple OCR providers are used to improve accuracy through consensus-based text recognition.

3. **Contextual Analysis**: Spatial relationships and betting slip patterns are analyzed to improve parsing accuracy.

4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and reporting is implemented throughout the system.

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with UI**: Integrate OCR services with the bet slip scanning UI.

2. **User Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback mechanism for OCR results to improve accuracy over time.

3. **Analytics Tracking**: Add analytics tracking for OCR accuracy metrics.

4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for OCR services.

## Components Created/Modified

1. **AccessibleTouchableOpacity** (atomic/atoms/AccessibleTouchableOpacity.tsx)

   - Enhanced with internal focus state tracking
   - Added support for animated focus transitions
   - Added proper accessibility attributes

2. **focusStateUtils** (atomic/atoms/focusStateUtils.ts)

   - Created useFocusState hook for managing focus state
   - Added utilities for creating focus styles
   - Added high contrast focus color utilities

3. **LanguageSelector** (atomic/molecules/language/LanguageSelector.tsx)

   - Refactored to use AccessibleTouchableOpacity
   - Added proper accessibility attributes
   - Improved screen reader support

4. **ThemeToggle** (atomic/molecules/theme/ThemeToggle.tsx)

   - Refactored to use AccessibleTouchableOpacity
   - Added proper accessibility attributes
   - Improved screen reader support

5. **Interactive Components** (components/\*.tsx)

   - Refactored to use AccessibleTouchableOpacity
   - Added proper accessibility attributes
   - Improved screen reader support

6. **SettingsScreen** (screens/SettingsScreen.tsx)

   - Replaced standard View components with AccessibleThemedView
   - Replaced standard Text components with AccessibleThemedText
   - Ensured all interactive elements use AccessibleTouchableOpacity
   - Added proper accessibility attributes (labels, roles, hints)

7. **PersonalizationScreen** (screens/PersonalizationScreen.tsx)
   - Replaced standard View components with AccessibleThemedView
   - Ensured all interactive elements use AccessibleTouchableOpacity
   - Added proper accessibility attributes (labels, roles, hints)

## Tests and Documentation

1. **AccessibleTouchableOpacity.test.tsx** (**tests**/accessibility/AccessibleTouchableOpacity.test.tsx)

   - Added tests for focus state behavior
   - Added tests for accessibility attributes
   - Added tests for press event handling

2. **focus-states.md** (docs/implementation-guides/focus-states.md)
   - Added documentation for focus state implementation
   - Added usage examples
   - Added best practices

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Atomic Design**: Focus state components are implemented at the atom level and composed into molecules and organisms.

2. **Accessibility First**: All components are designed with accessibility in mind, including proper ARIA attributes and screen reader support.

3. **Customizability**: Focus styles can be customized for different components while maintaining a consistent base style.

4. **Performance**: Focus state animations are optimized for performance using React Native's Animated API.

## Next Steps

1. **Refactor Additional Screens**: Continue refactoring remaining screens to use accessible components:

   - PersonalizationScreen
   - PaymentScreen
   - BettingAnalyticsScreen
   - OddsComparisonScreen
   - SignupScreen
   - ForgotPasswordScreen

2. **Accessibility Testing**: Conduct thorough accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

3. **Documentation Updates**: Update component documentation to include focus state usage.

4. **CI/CD Integration**: Add accessibility checks to CI/CD pipeline.

5. **Localization Testing**: Complete localization testing for accessibility features in Spanish/English.
