# Active Context: Unified Admin Dashboard Implementation

## Previous Context: Voice Control Implementation

_Note: This section preserved for historical context_

Implementing voice control accessibility features in the AI Sports Edge app. This work focuses on enhancing the accessibility of the app by providing voice command support as an alternative input method for users with mobility impairments or those who prefer voice interaction.

## Current Implementation Focus

Creating a comprehensive technical specification for the Unified Admin Dashboard project. This work focuses on designing a web-based admin dashboard that integrates with the existing React Native admin screens, providing enhanced monitoring capabilities and predictive analytics.

### Key Components:

### Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure the dashboard works seamlessly with the existing React Native admin screens.

2. **Performance First**: Optimize for fast loading and response times, with <200ms API response times.

3. **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSockets for critical data that needs real-time updates.

4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the dashboard works well on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

5. **Accessibility**: Implement proper accessibility features for all components.

### Priority Tasks

1. **Draft Technical Specifications for All Phases:**

   - Create detailed technical specifications for Phases 2-5
   - Include component designs, API requirements, and integration details
   - Ensure consistency across all phases

2. **Implement Sentry Configuration:**

   - Set up Sentry for error tracking and monitoring
   - Configure error boundaries for React components
   - Implement custom error handling with Sentry integration
   - Add performance monitoring for critical operations

3. **Begin Phase 2 Implementation:**
   - Set up the Next.js project structure
   - Implement the core layout components
   - Set up the authentication flow
   - Create protected routes
   - Implement the API service layer
   - Create initial dashboard screens with placeholder data

   - Enhanced keyboard navigation
   - Added voice control support with specific commands:
     - "subscribe now" - Completes the payment process
     - "cancel payment" - Returns to the previous screen
     - "focus card field" - Sets focus to the card input field

4. **Voice Control Example Component**

   - Created VoiceControlExample component to demonstrate voice control integration
   - Implemented voice command registration
   - Added UI for toggling voice control
   - Created command log for executed commands
   - Demonstrated voice control integration with UI elements

5. **Documentation**

   - Created comprehensive voice control documentation
   - Documented API methods and interfaces
   - Provided usage examples and best practices
   - Included testing guidance
   - Added implementation details to memory bank

### Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Accessibility First**: All components are designed with accessibility in mind, including proper ARIA attributes, screen reader support, and voice control.

2. **Modular Design**: Voice control functionality is implemented in a modular way, allowing for easy integration with existing components.

3. **Extensibility**: The voice control system is designed to be easily extended with new commands and features.

4. **Performance**: Voice recognition is only active when needed to minimize performance impact.

5. **User Control**: Users can enable/disable voice control through accessibility preferences.

### Next Steps

1. **Integrate Voice Control with Screen Reader**

   - Ensure voice commands work well with screen readers
   - Add voice feedback for screen reader users
   - Test with VoiceOver and TalkBack

## Implementation Details

The voice control implementation provides a way to register voice commands that can trigger actions within the app. The implementation is designed to be:

- **Extensible**: New voice commands can be easily added to any component
- **Consistent**: Voice commands follow a consistent pattern across the app
- **Discoverable**: Users can access a list of available voice commands
- **Configurable**: Users can enable/disable voice control in accessibility settings

Voice commands are registered using the VoiceCommandHandler interface:

```typescript
interface VoiceCommandHandler {
  // Command phrase to listen for
  command: string;

  // Handler function to execute when command is recognized
  handler: () => void;

  // Description of what the command does (for help screens)
  description: string;
}
```

Components can register commands during initialization and clean up on unmount:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const unregister = accessibilityService.registerVoiceCommand({
    command: 'go home',
    handler: () => navigation.navigate('Home'),
    description: 'Navigates to the home screen',
  });

  return () => unregister();
}, []);
```

The implementation includes a placeholder for voice recognition that would be replaced with a real voice recognition library in production.
