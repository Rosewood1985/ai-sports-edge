# Active Context - 2025-04-17

## Current Focus

Updating the iOS mobile app to match the web app functionality, with a focus on Firebase compatibility and feature parity.

## Recent Issues

1. **500 Internal Server Error on GoDaddy hosting**
   - Caused by malformed `.htaccess` file
   - Fixed by implementing properly formatted configuration
   - Verified solution works correctly

2. **Firebase loading issues due to Content Security Policy**
   - Firebase scripts were blocked by restrictive CSP
   - Fixed by updating CSP to allow Firebase domains and required directives
   - Implemented diagnostic tools to verify Firebase functionality

3. **Firebase Authentication API Key Issue**
   - Error message: "Firebase: Error (auth/api-key-not-valid.-please-pass-a-valid-api-key.)"
   - Misleading error message - the API key was valid
   - Root cause: CSP missing `'unsafe-eval'` in the `script-src` directive
   - Fixed by updating CSP to include `'unsafe-eval'`
   - Created implementation scripts and verification tools

4. **Firebase Authentication API Key Issue (2025-04-17)**
   - Error message: "Firebase: Error (auth/api-key-not-valid.-please-pass-a-valid-api-key.)"
   - Root causes:
     - CSP missing `https://www.gstatic.com` in the `script-src` directive
     - Project configuration mismatch in .env file (using "ai-sports-edge-prod" instead of "ai-sports-edge")
   - Fixed by:
     - Updating CSP to include `https://www.gstatic.com`
     - Correcting project configuration in .env file
   - Verified solution by testing sign-up functionality

## Current Status

1. ✅ Fixed 500 Internal Server Error
2. ✅ Fixed Firebase loading issues
3. ✅ Fixed Firebase Authentication API Key issue
4. ✅ Created diagnostic and verification tools
5. ✅ Created automated implementation scripts
6. ✅ Created documentation
7. ✅ Updated memory bank
8. ✅ Created version control scripts

## Current Environment

- **Web Platform**: GoDaddy hosting with Firebase integration
- **Mobile Platform**: iOS app that needs updating to match web functionality
- **Firebase Services**: Authentication, Firestore, Storage
- **Key Technologies**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Swift, Firebase SDK

## Key Stakeholders

- Website users experiencing 500 errors and authentication issues
- Mobile app users needing feature parity with web
- Development team maintaining both platforms

## Priority Tasks

1. **Analyze iOS app current state**
   - Review existing code and functionality
   - Identify Firebase integration points
   - Document feature gaps compared to web app

2. **Plan iOS app updates**
   - Create implementation plan for Firebase compatibility
   - Design UI/UX updates to match web experience
   - Establish testing strategy for cross-platform functionality

3. **Implement iOS updates**
   - Update Firebase SDK and configuration
   - Implement missing features
   - Ensure consistent user experience across platforms

## Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Must ensure security of Firebase implementation
- Must provide consistent user experience across platforms
- Must handle offline functionality appropriately

## Recent Learnings

1. **Firebase Authentication Requirements**
   - Requires `'unsafe-eval'` in CSP `script-src` directive
   - Error messages can be misleading (API key error when CSP is the issue)
   - Needs specific domains in CSP for authentication to work

2. **GoDaddy Hosting Considerations**
   - Sensitive to `.htaccess` syntax errors
   - May have different CSP requirements than other hosting providers
   - Requires compatibility scripts for Firebase to work properly
