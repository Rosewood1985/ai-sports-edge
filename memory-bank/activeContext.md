# Active Context: Voice Control Implementation

## Previous Context: Dependency Management Implementation

_Note: This section preserved for historical context_

Implementing real solutions for dependency management issues in the AI Sports Edge project. This work focuses on creating tools and documentation to systematically address dependency problems rather than creating workarounds.

## Current Implementation Focus

Implementing voice control accessibility features in the AI Sports Edge app. This work focuses on enhancing the accessibility of the app by providing voice command support as an alternative input method for users with mobility impairments or those who prefer voice interaction.

### Key Activities:

1. **AccessibilityService Enhancement**

   - Added voice control preferences to AccessibilityPreferences
   - Implemented voice command registration and handling
   - Added voice recognition state management
   - Added methods for enabling/disabling voice control
   - Created VoiceCommandHandler interface for command registration

2. **AccessibleTouchableOpacity Enhancement**

   - Added keyboard navigation properties (keyboardNavigationId, nextElementId, prevElementId)
   - Implemented integration with AccessibilityService for keyboard navigation
   - Enhanced focus state handling for better accessibility

3. **PaymentScreen Refactoring**

   - Added proper accessibility labels and hints
   - Ensured all interactive elements use AccessibleTouchableOpacity
   - Implemented proper focus management
   - Added screen reader support
   - Enhanced keyboard navigation

4. **Voice Control Example Component**

   - Created VoiceControlExample component to demonstrate voice control integration
   - Implemented voice command registration
   - Added UI for toggling voice control
   - Created command log for executed commands
   - Demonstrated voice control integration with UI elements

5. **Documentation**

   - Created comprehensive voice control documentation
   - Documented API methods and interfaces
   - Provided usage examples and best practices
   - Included testing guidance
   - Added implementation details to memory bank

### Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Accessibility First**: All components are designed with accessibility in mind, including proper ARIA attributes, screen reader support, and voice control.

2. **Modular Design**: Voice control functionality is implemented in a modular way, allowing for easy integration with existing components.

3. **Extensibility**: The voice control system is designed to be easily extended with new commands and features.

4. **Performance**: Voice recognition is only active when needed to minimize performance impact.

5. **User Control**: Users can enable/disable voice control through accessibility preferences.

### Next Steps

1. **Integrate Voice Control with Screen Reader**

   - Ensure voice commands work well with screen readers
   - Add voice feedback for screen reader users
   - Test with VoiceOver and TalkBack

2. **Implement Real Voice Recognition**

   - Integrate with a voice recognition library like react-native-voice
   - Add support for different languages and accents
   - Implement error handling for voice recognition

3. **Add Multi-language Support**

   - Support voice commands in multiple languages
   - Add automatic language detection
   - Ensure proper localization of voice command feedback

4. **Create Automated Tests**

   - Add tests for voice command handling
   - Test voice control with screen reader
   - Test voice control with keyboard navigation

5. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Update component documentation to include voice control usage
   - Add voice control to accessibility guidelines
   - Create voice command reference guide

## Components Created/Modified

1. **AccessibilityService** (services/accessibilityService.ts)

   - Added voice control preferences
   - Implemented voice command registration and handling
   - Added voice recognition state management
   - Added methods for enabling/disabling voice control

2. **AccessibleTouchableOpacity** (atomic/atoms/AccessibleTouchableOpacity.tsx)

   - Added keyboard navigation properties
   - Implemented integration with AccessibilityService for keyboard navigation
   - Enhanced focus state handling

3. **PaymentScreen** (screens/PaymentScreen.tsx)

   - Refactored with proper accessibility features
   - Added keyboard navigation support
   - Improved focus management
   - Enhanced screen reader support

4. **VoiceControlExample** (components/examples/VoiceControlExample.tsx)

   - Created example component demonstrating voice control integration
   - Shows how to register and handle voice commands
   - Provides UI for toggling voice control
   - Displays command log for executed commands

5. **Voice Control Documentation** (docs/accessibility/voice-control.md)
   - Created comprehensive documentation for voice control features
   - Included usage examples and best practices
   - Documented API methods and interfaces
   - Provided guidance for testing voice control

## Implementation Details

The voice control implementation provides a way to register voice commands that can trigger actions within the app. The implementation is designed to be:

- **Extensible**: New voice commands can be easily added to any component
- **Consistent**: Voice commands follow a consistent pattern across the app
- **Discoverable**: Users can access a list of available voice commands
- **Configurable**: Users can enable/disable voice control in accessibility settings

Voice commands are registered using the VoiceCommandHandler interface:

```typescript
interface VoiceCommandHandler {
  // Command phrase to listen for
  command: string;

  // Handler function to execute when command is recognized
  handler: () => void;

  // Description of what the command does (for help screens)
  description: string;
}
```

Components can register commands during initialization and clean up on unmount:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const unregister = accessibilityService.registerVoiceCommand({
    command: 'go home',
    handler: () => navigation.navigate('Home'),
    description: 'Navigates to the home screen',
  });

  return () => unregister();
}, []);
```

The implementation includes a placeholder for voice recognition that would be replaced with a real voice recognition library in production.
