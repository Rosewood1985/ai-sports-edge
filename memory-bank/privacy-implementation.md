# Privacy Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive privacy management system for AI Sports Edge to comply with GDPR and CCPA requirements. The implementation follows the atomic design pattern with clear separation of concerns between data types, business logic, and user interface.

## Implementation Details

### Data Layer (Atoms)

- **privacyTypes.ts**: Defined TypeScript interfaces for privacy-related data structures, including:

  - `PrivacyPreferences`: User preferences for marketing, analytics, etc.
  - `ConsentRecord`: Records of user consent for various purposes
  - `DataAccessRequest`: Request for accessing personal data
  - `DataDeletionRequest`: Request for deleting personal data
  - `PrivacyRequestUnion`: Union type for all privacy requests

- **gdprConfig.ts**: Defined configuration for privacy request types and statuses:

  - `PrivacyRequestType`: Enum for request types (ACCESS, DELETION)
  - `PrivacyRequestStatus`: Enum for request statuses (PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED)

- **dataCategories.ts**: Defined data categories and their properties:

  - Added `canDelete` property to control whether data can be deleted or must be anonymized
  - Defined retention periods for each data category
  - Specified legal basis for processing each data category

- **storageUtils.ts**: Implemented utilities for encrypting and anonymizing data

### Business Logic Layer (Molecules)

- **DataAccessManager.ts**: Implemented functionality for handling data access requests:

  - Creating data access requests
  - Processing data access requests
  - Collecting user data from various sources
  - Formatting user data for export
  - Generating download URLs for data exports

- **DataDeletionManager.ts**: Implemented functionality for handling data deletion requests:

  - Creating data deletion requests
  - Processing data deletion requests
  - Deleting or anonymizing user data based on category
  - Handling full account deletion

- **PrivacyManager.ts**: Created a main entry point for privacy-related functionality:

  - Managing privacy preferences
  - Recording and checking user consent
  - Creating and processing privacy requests
  - Verifying user identity for privacy requests

- **index.js**: Created an export file for all privacy-related functionality

### UI Layer (Organisms)

- **PrivacySettingsScreen.tsx**: Implemented a user interface for managing privacy settings:

  - Viewing and updating privacy preferences
  - Requesting access to personal data
  - Requesting deletion of specific data categories or entire account
  - Viewing the status of privacy requests

- **index.js**: Created an export file for the privacy settings screen

## Technical Decisions

1. **Data Category Management**: Implemented a system to categorize data and define properties for each category, including whether the data can be deleted or must be anonymized. This allows for fine-grained control over data deletion.

2. **Request-Based Architecture**: Used a request-based architecture for data access and deletion, where users create requests that are processed asynchronously. This allows for verification steps and provides a clear audit trail.

3. **Firebase Integration**: Integrated with Firebase Firestore for storing privacy preferences, consent records, and privacy requests. This provides a reliable and scalable backend for privacy management.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Maintained clear separation between data types, business logic, and user interface, following the atomic design pattern. This makes the code more maintainable and testable.

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated Data Retention**: Implement a system to automatically delete or anonymize data after its retention period.

2. **Enhanced Consent Management**: Add more granular consent options and improve the consent flow.

3. **Privacy Impact Assessments**: Implement tools for conducting privacy impact assessments for new features.

4. **Data Portability**: Enhance data export formats to improve interoperability with other systems.

5. **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging for all privacy-related actions.

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation for the privacy implementation:

- **Implementation Guide**: Created `docs/implementation-guides/privacy-compliance.md` with detailed information on how to use the privacy features.
