# Unified Admin Dashboard Project Memory

## Project Overview

The Unified Admin Dashboard is a web-based administration interface for the AI Sports Edge platform. It provides a centralized location for managing users, content, analytics, and system health. The dashboard is built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and integrates with the existing Firebase backend.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (COMPLETED)

Phase 1 focused on creating a comprehensive technical specification document for the Unified Admin Dashboard. This phase established the foundation for the entire project, defining the architecture, component structure, authentication approach, API service layer, and integration strategy.

### Key Deliverables

- **Technical Specification Document**: [unified-admin-dashboard-technical-spec.md](../unified-admin-dashboard-technical-spec.md)
- **Progress Tracking Document**: [unified-admin-dashboard-progress.md](../unified-admin-dashboard-progress.md)

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Authentication Approach:**

   - Using Firebase Auth with custom JWT tokens
   - Implementing shared authentication middleware between web and mobile
   - Storing tokens in HTTP-only cookies for web security

2. **API Architecture:**

   - Implementing API gateway pattern for request routing
   - Using SWR for data fetching with stale-while-revalidate caching
   - Adding WebSocket integration for real-time updates

3. **UI Component Strategy:**
   - Converting React Native components to web equivalents
   - Maintaining consistent styling and behavior across platforms
   - Using responsive design for all screen sizes

### Implementation Details

The technical specification document provides detailed implementation plans for:

1. **Project Setup & Configuration**:

   - Package.json dependencies and versions
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Tailwind configuration
   - Next.js configuration
   - Environment variables
   - Folder structure

2. **Core Layout Components**:

   - Component interfaces
   - Component hierarchy
   - State management
   - Responsive design

3. **Authentication Integration**:

   - Authentication flow
   - JWT token structure
   - Auth context implementation
   - Protected routes
   - Session management
   - Integration with existing admin auth system

4. **API Service Layer**:

   - API service interfaces
   - Error handling
   - Retry mechanisms
   - SWR configuration
   - WebSocket integration
   - Example implementation
   - Data models

5. **Integration Strategy**:
   - API compatibility
   - Shared authentication
   - Data synchronization
   - Cross-platform navigation
   - Shared UI component strategy

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Priority Tasks

1. **Draft Technical Specifications for All Phases:**

   - Create detailed technical specifications for Phases 2-5
   - Include component designs, API requirements, and integration details
   - Ensure consistency across all phases

2. **Implement Sentry Configuration:**

   - Set up Sentry for error tracking and monitoring
   - Configure error boundaries for React components
   - Implement custom error handling with Sentry integration
   - Add performance monitoring for critical operations

3. **Begin Phase 2 Implementation:**
   - Set up the Next.js project structure
   - Implement the core layout components
   - Set up the authentication flow
   - Create protected routes
   - Implement the API service layer
   - Create initial dashboard screens with placeholder data

## Technical Considerations

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing mobile admin screens
- Ensure consistent data models between web and mobile platforms
- Monitor performance metrics to maintain <200ms API response times
- Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the system
- Use shared authentication middleware for both web and mobile platforms
- Implement real-time updates via WebSockets for critical data
