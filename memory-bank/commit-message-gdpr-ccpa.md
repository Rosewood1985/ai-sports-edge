# Commit Message: GDPR/CCPA Compliance Implementation (Phase 1)

feat(privacy): Implement GDPR/CCPA compliance framework

This commit adds the core infrastructure for GDPR/CCPA compliance, following our atomic architecture pattern. It includes:

- Add privacy configuration settings and feature flags
- Define TypeScript interfaces for privacy-related data structures
- Create data category definitions and field mappings
- Implement secure storage utilities for privacy data
- Add comprehensive documentation for privacy compliance implementation

The implementation follows the plan outlined in memory-bank/gdpr-ccpa-compliance-plan.md and provides the foundation for implementing user consent management, data access and portability, and data deletion features.
