# System Patterns

## Atomic Design Implementation

### Reporting System Components

The reporting system follows the atomic design methodology, breaking down components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.

#### Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of the system, representing the smallest functional UI elements.

- **TemplateStatusBadge**: Displays the status/type of a report template with appropriate styling.
- **WidgetChip**: Displays a widget as a chip with consistent styling.
- **ScheduleStatusBadge**: Displays the status of a scheduled report (active, paused, error).
- **FrequencyBadge**: Displays the frequency of a scheduled report (daily, weekly, monthly).
- **RecipientChip**: Displays a recipient email or user as a chip with consistent styling.
- **HistoryStatusBadge**: Displays the status of a report history item (success, failed).
- **FormatBadge**: Displays the format of a report (PDF, CSV, Excel).
- **DateRangePicker**: Provides a date range picker for filtering reports.

#### Molecules

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together, forming more complex UI components.

- **TemplateCard**: Displays a report template as a card, including its name, description, type, and widgets.
- **TemplateActions**: Provides a menu of actions for a template (edit, generate, duplicate, delete).
- **JobProgressIndicator**: Displays the progress of an asynchronous job with status information.
- **ScheduledReportCard**: Displays a scheduled report as a card, including its name, frequency, and status.
- **ReportHistoryCard**: Displays a report history item as a card, including its name, generation time, and status.

#### Organisms

Organisms are groups of molecules functioning together as a unit.

- **TemplateList**: Displays a list of report templates with functionality to create, edit, and delete templates.
- **ReportTemplateForm**: Provides a form for creating and editing report templates.
- **ScheduledReportsList**: Displays a list of scheduled reports with filtering and pagination.
- **ReportHistoryList**: Displays a list of report history items with filtering and pagination.

### Asynchronous Processing Architecture

The reporting system uses an asynchronous processing architecture to handle potentially long-running tasks.

#### Job Queue System

- **JobQueueService**: Manages the creation, retrieval, and processing of jobs.
- **Job Types**: Different types of jobs (report generation, export, preview) with specific parameters.
- **Job Status**: Jobs can be in various states (pending, processing, completed, failed, cancelled).
- **Job Priority**: Jobs can have different priorities (high, medium, low).

#### React Hooks

- **useJobQueue**: Hook for interacting with the job queue.
- **useJobTracking**: Hook for tracking the progress of a specific job.
- **useReportGeneration**: Hook for creating report generation jobs.

### UI Component Patterns

#### Form Patterns

- **Validation**: Forms include client-side validation with error messages.
- **Loading States**: Forms show loading indicators during submission.
- **Error Handling**: Forms display error messages when submission fails.

#### List Patterns

- **Empty State**: Lists show a helpful message when empty.
- **Loading State**: Lists show a loading indicator when data is being fetched.
- **Error State**: Lists show an error message when data fetching fails.
- **Filtering**: Lists include filtering options for narrowing down results.
- **Pagination**: Lists include pagination for handling large datasets.
- **Search**: Lists include search functionality for finding specific items.

#### Dialog Patterns

- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Used for destructive actions like deletion.
- **Form Dialogs**: Used for creating and editing items.
- **Progress Dialogs**: Used for displaying progress of long-running operations.

### State Management Patterns

- **Local Component State**: Used for UI state that doesn't need to be shared.
- **React Context**: Used for sharing state between components.
- **Custom Hooks**: Used for encapsulating complex state logic.

### API Integration Patterns

- **Service Layer**: API calls are abstracted behind service functions.
- **Mock Implementation**: Services include mock implementations for development.
- **Error Handling**: Services include consistent error handling.
- **Loading States**: Components show loading indicators during API calls.

### Material UI Integration Patterns

- **Grid Layout**: Using Material UI Grid for responsive layouts.
- **Card Components**: Using Material UI Card components for consistent styling.
- **Form Components**: Using Material UI form components for consistent styling and behavior.
- **Dialog Components**: Using Material UI Dialog components for consistent styling and behavior.
- **Typography**: Using Material UI Typography for consistent text styling.
- **Theme Integration**: Using Material UI theming for consistent colors and styling.
