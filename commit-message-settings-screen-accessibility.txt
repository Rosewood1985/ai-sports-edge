feat(accessibility): Enhance SettingsScreen with accessibility features

- Replace standard View components with AccessibleThemedView
- Replace standard Text components with AccessibleThemedText
- Ensure all interactive elements use AccessibleTouchableOpacity
- Add proper accessibility attributes (labels, roles, hints)
- Update progress tracking in memory-bank

This commit continues the systematic implementation of accessibility features
across the app, following the pattern established in ProfileScreen (commit 9089eee).
These changes improve screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.
