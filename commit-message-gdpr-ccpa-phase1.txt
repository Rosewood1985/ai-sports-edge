feat(privacy): Implement GDPR/CCPA compliance core infrastructure

This commit adds the core infrastructure for GDPR/CCPA compliance, following our atomic architecture pattern:

- Add privacy configuration settings and feature flags in gdprConfig.ts
- Define TypeScript interfaces for privacy-related data structures in privacyTypes.ts
- Create data retention policies and utilities in dataRetentionPolicies.ts
- Implement data retention job scheduling in initializeDataRetention.ts
- Add comprehensive documentation for privacy compliance implementation

The implementation provides the foundation for implementing user consent management, data access and portability, and data deletion features in subsequent phases.
