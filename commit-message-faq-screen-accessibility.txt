feat(accessibility): Enhance FAQScreen with accessible components

- Replace standard Text components with AccessibleThemedText
- Replace View components with AccessibleThemedView
- Replace TouchableOpacity with AccessibleTouchableOpacity
- Add proper semantic structure with heading hierarchy (h1, h2)
- Add appropriate accessibility labels, roles, and states
