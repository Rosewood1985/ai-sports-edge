**Date:** 5/12/2025

## Changes Made

1. Simplified `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` to a minimal version:
   - Base image: `node:18-bullseye`
   - Minimal dependencies: git, curl
   - Only TypeScript installed globally
   - Clean workspace setup

2. Simplified `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to a minimal version:
   - Minimal configuration with only essential settings
   - Forward ports for Expo (19000, 19001, 19002)
   - Only essential VS Code extensions (ESLint, Prettier)

## Benefits

- Faster container build times
- Reduced resource usage
- Cleaner development environment
- Easier maintenance and troubleshooting
