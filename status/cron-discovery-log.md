# Cron Discovery Log

## Overview
This log documents the discovery and consolidation of recurring tasks across the AI Sports Edge codebase.

## Existing Cron Tasks
The following tasks were found in the existing `.cronrc` file:

| Interval | Label | Command |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 3m | save-context | ./scripts/save-context.sh "[AUTO] Recurring context save" |
| 10m | tag-scan | ./scripts/tag-context.sh --auto |
| 15m | update-progress | ./scripts/clean-and-sort-progress.sh |
| 1h | checkpoint | ./scripts/update-memory-bank.js --checkpoint |

## Legacy Cron Tasks
The following tasks were found in legacy cron setup files:

### From setup-all-cron.command
```bash
0 8 * * * ~/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/start-my-day.command
0 12 * * * ~/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/save-and-wrap-midday.command
0 17 * * * ~/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/daily-wrap-evening.command
0 23 * * * ~/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/overnight-sync-late-night.command
30 2 * * * ~/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/scripts/update-model.sh
0 4 * * 0 ~/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/clean-database-weekly.command
1 0 * * * ~/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/auto-archive-kickoff.command
```

### From setup-friday-cron.command
```bash
30 16 * * 5 ~/Desktop/ai-sports-edge/friday-sprint-review.command
```

## Proposed New Tasks
The following tasks were identified from code patterns and documentation but are not currently scheduled:

| Interval | Label | Command | Source |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| 5m | sync-tasks | ./scripts/sync-tasks-with-memory-bank.sh | GPT persona instructions (task cache sync) |
| 30m | log-summary | ./scripts/generate-summary-log.sh | memory-bank/weekly-review.md (referenced) |
| 1h | checkpoint-docs | ./scripts/update-memory-bank.js --checkpoint | Duplicate of existing checkpoint task |
| 12h | weekly-review | ./scripts/run-weekly-checks.sh | Legacy context-check.js |
| 24h | security-audit | ./scripts/check-security-policies.sh | systemPatterns.md (mentioned but not implemented) |

## Merge Analysis

### Duplications
- `checkpoint-docs` is a duplicate of the existing `checkpoint` task and should be omitted
- The existing `.cronrc` already has a task for updating memory bank checkpoints

### Missing Scripts
The following scripts referenced in the proposed tasks do not exist yet:
- `./scripts/sync-tasks-with-memory-bank.sh`
- `./scripts/generate-summary-log.sh`
- `./scripts/run-weekly-checks.sh`
- `./scripts/check-security-policies.sh`

### Recommended Merges
After analyzing the existing and proposed tasks, the following merges are recommended:

1. Add `sync-tasks` (5m) - New functionality for task cache synchronization
2. Add `log-summary` (30m) - New functionality for generating summary logs
3. Skip `checkpoint-docs` - Duplicate of existing `checkpoint` task
4. Add `weekly-review` (12h) - New functionality for weekly checks
5. Add `security-audit` (24h) - New functionality for security audits

## Next Steps
1. Create the missing script files
2. Merge the recommended tasks into `.cronrc`
3. Remove `.cronrc.staging` after merge is complete

## Merge Results
The following tasks have been merged into `.cronrc`:

| Interval | Label | Command | Status |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| 5m | sync-tasks | ./scripts/sync-tasks-with-memory-bank.sh | ✅ Added |
| 30m | log-summary | ./scripts/generate-summary-log.sh | ✅ Added |
| 12h | weekly-review | ./scripts/run-weekly-checks.sh | ✅ Added |
| 24h | security-audit | ./scripts/check-security-policies.sh | ✅ Added |

The `checkpoint-docs` task was skipped as it duplicates the existing `checkpoint` task.

All merged tasks have been tagged with `# ROO-MERGED` in the `.cronrc` file.

## Implementation Status
The following scripts need to be created to support the new tasks:

- [x] `./scripts/sync-tasks-with-memory-bank.sh`
- [x] `./scripts/generate-summary-log.sh`
- [x] `./scripts/run-weekly-checks.sh`
- [x] `./scripts/check-security-policies.sh`

All scripts have been created and made executable. The cronrc-runner will automatically pick up the new tasks.

## Implementation Details

The following scripts have been implemented:

1. **sync-tasks-with-memory-bank.sh**
   - Synchronizes tasks between the memory bank and task tracking system
   - Extracts tasks from memory bank files and the main todo file
   - Creates a status file with synchronization information

2. **generate-summary-log.sh**
   - Generates a summary log of recent activities
   - Collects information from git commits, memory bank updates, and file changes
   - Creates a comprehensive activity report in the status directory

3. **run-weekly-checks.sh**
   - Performs weekly maintenance checks on the project
   - Checks for large files, duplicate files, memory bank integrity, and more
   - Generates a detailed report with recommendations

4. **check-security-policies.sh**
   - Verifies security policies and configurations
   - Checks for sensitive information, insecure dependencies, and proper security settings
   - Provides recommendations for improving security

All scripts follow the project's conventions with proper error handling, logging, and header comments.
