# Firebase Hosting Integration Log

## 2025-05-09

### Completed

- Configured Firebase Hosting for aisportsedge.app
- Set up custom domain configuration in Firebase
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- Updated firebase.json with proper hosting configuration
- Set up proper security headers and HTTPS enforcement
- Configured redirects and rewrites

### Deployment Process

Deployment now uses GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to Firebase hosting when changes are pushed to the main branch. The workflow:

1. Triggers on pushes to the main branch
2. Builds the project if needed
3. Deploys to Firebase hosting site aisportsedge-app
4. Includes proper authentication using Firebase service account

### DNS Configuration

The following DNS records have been set up:

- A record for aisportsedge.app pointing to Firebase hosting
- CNAME record for www.aisportsedge.app pointing to aisportsedge.app
- TXT records for domain verification

### Security

The following security measures have been implemented:

- HTTPS enforcement
- Proper security headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Cache control headers

### Next Steps

1. Monitor the deployment process to ensure it's working correctly
2. Set up monitoring and alerts for the Firebase hosting site
3. Implement performance optimizations for the hosted site
4. Set up staging environment for testing before production deployment

### Notes

- The Firebase hosting configuration is now the source of truth for deployment
- All deployments should go through the GitHub Actions workflow
- Manual deployments should be avoided to maintain consistency
