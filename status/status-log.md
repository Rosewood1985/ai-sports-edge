### Components Created

1. **Analysis Scripts**:
   - `scripts/generate-implementation-status.js`: Analyzes the codebase to determine which architectural components have been implemented
   - `scripts/find-recent-files.sh`: Finds recently created or modified files and generates a report

### Features

- **Implementation Status Analysis**:
  - Checks for atomic architecture implementation (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
  - Detects Firebase integration components
  - Identifies core app infrastructure components
  - Analyzes UI component implementation
  - Checks for betting feature implementation
  - Evaluates user experience components

- **Recent Files Tracking**:
  - Finds files created or modified within a specified time period
  - Categorizes files by type and directory
  - Generates a comprehensive report with recommendations

### Usage

1. **Generate Implementation Status Report**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-implementation-status.js > status/implementation-status.md
   ```

2. **Find Recently Modified Files**:
   ```bash
   # Default: last 7 days
   ./scripts/find-recent-files.sh
   
   # Custom time period
   ./scripts/find-recent-files.sh --days 30
   
   # Custom output file
   ./scripts/find-recent-files.sh --output custom-report.md
   ```

### Notes

- The implementation status report helps track progress against the architectural plan
- The recent files report helps identify active development areas
- Both tools support the Firebase migration process by providing insights into the codebase

## Firebase Migration Tracking System (2025-05-09)

### Summary
Created a comprehensive Firebase migration tracking system to consolidate multiple Firebase implementations into a single, consistent set of Firebase services using the atomic architecture pattern.

### Components Created

1. **Migration Tracking Scripts**:
   - `scripts/firebase-migration-tracker.sh`: Tracks the status of files being migrated, manages migration phases, and generates reports
   - `scripts/migrate-to-firebase-service.js`: Analyzes files for Firebase usage and generates migration plans
   - `scripts/create-migration-example.js`: Creates examples of how to migrate a file to use atomic architecture
   - `scripts/migrate-firebase-file.js`: Automatically migrates simple Firebase files
   - `scripts/test-migrated-files.sh`: Runs tests for migrated files

2. **Documentation**:
   - `docs/firebase-migration-process.md`: Comprehensive guide for the Firebase migration process

### Migration Phases

1. **Critical Components**: Core Firebase configuration and initialization files
2. **Auth Services**: Authentication-related files
3. **Data Services**: Firestore and database-related files
4. **Storage Services**: File storage-related files
5. **Analytics Services**: Analytics and tracking-related files

### Features

- **Phase Management**: Start, track, and complete migration phases
- **File Tracking**: Track the status of each file (pending, migrated, deleted)
- **Automated Analysis**: Analyze files to determine Firebase usage and migration complexity
- **Migration Examples**: Generate examples of how to migrate files
- **Automated Migration**: Automatically migrate simple Firebase files
- **Testing**: Run tests for migrated files
- **Reporting**: Generate migration reports and status updates

### Next Steps

1. **Start Migration**:
   - Run `./scripts/firebase-migration-tracker.sh start-phase critical_components`
   - Analyze files using `node scripts/migrate-to-firebase-service.js --analyze <file_path>`
   - Create migration examples or automatically migrate files
   - Test and mark files as migrated

2. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Check status using `./scripts/firebase-migration-tracker.sh status`
   - Generate reports using `./scripts/firebase-migration-tracker.sh generate-report`

3. **Complete Migration**:
   - Proceed through all migration phases
   - Verify all files are migrated or deleted
   - Update documentation

### Notes

- The migration system creates backups of all files before migration
- Migration examples show before/after code for easy reference
- The system tracks migration progress and generates reports
- All scripts are designed to be idempotent and safe to run multiple times

## Firebase Hosting Integration (2025-05-09)

### Summary
Integrated AI Sports Edge with Firebase Hosting using custom domain aisportsedge.app. Created scripts for consolidating existing design assets, updating Firebase configuration, and automating deployment through GitHub Actions.

### Components Created

1. **Integration Scripts**:
   - `scripts/integrate_existing_design.js`: Consolidates HTML, CSS, JS, and image assets from various project directories into the dist directory for Firebase hosting
   - `scripts/update_firebase_config.js`: Updates firebase.json with proper hosting configuration, security headers, and custom domain settings
   - `scripts/deploy-to-firebase.sh`: Shell script for manual deployment to Firebase hosting

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml`: Automates deployment to Firebase hosting on push to main branch

3. **Documentation**:
   - `docs/firebase-custom-domain-setup.md`: Instructions for setting up DNS records for custom domain
   - `docs/firebase-github-actions-setup.md`: Guide for configuring GitHub Actions with Firebase
   - `docs/firebase-hosting-integration.md`: Overview of the Firebase hosting integration architecture

### Configuration Details

- **Firebase Project**: ai-sports-edge-final
- **Hosting Site**: aisportsedge-app
- **Custom Domains**: aisportsedge.app, www.aisportsedge.app
- **Security Headers**: Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.
- **Cache Control**: Optimized for different asset types

### Next Steps

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Run `firebase login` to authenticate with Firebase
   - Run `firebase use --add` to select the project
   - Run `scripts/deploy-to-firebase.sh` for initial deployment

2. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Configure A records for root domain
   - Configure CNAME record for www subdomain
   - Verify domain ownership with TXT record

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor deployment status in Firebase Console
   - Verify SSL certificate provisioning
   - Test site functionality on custom domain

### Notes

- The integration scripts handle path fixing in HTML and CSS files
- Duplicate files are automatically detected and skipped
- GitHub Actions workflow requires FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT secret to be configured
- Security headers are configured for optimal protection while allowing necessary functionality-e # File Organization Update - Sun May 11 12:59:25 EDT 2025

## Files Moved to Archive

- App.tsx.bak → /archive/src/
- ai-sports-edge-todo.md.bak → /archive/tasks/
- routes.js.bak → /archive/src/navigation/
- tsconfig.json.bak → /archive/
- webpack.config.js.bak → /archive/

These backup files were moved to the archive directory to maintain a clean project structure according to the project rules.

## Memory Bank Consolidation: infra-context-guide-md

- **Date:** 2025-05-13
- **Files Consolidated:** 5
- **Base File:** decisionLog.md
- **Related Files:** app-history.md, background-consolidation-authority.md, progress.md, activeContext.md
- **Conflicts:** 2 (see checkpoint for details)
