### Migration Patterns Applied

All service file migrations follow these established patterns:

- Replace direct Firebase imports with imports from the atomic architecture
- Replace direct Firebase method calls with calls to the atomic Firebase service
- Update Firebase initialization code to use the atomic Firebase service
- Maintain the same functionality while improving code organization and testability

### Benefits

These migrations deliver several key benefits:

1. **Centralized Configuration**: All Firebase configuration is now managed in a single location
2. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized approach to error handling across services
3. **Simplified Testing**: Services can now be tested with mocked Firebase dependencies
4. **Improved Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with atomic architecture
5. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated redundant Firebase initialization code
6. **Better Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript typing for Firebase interactions
