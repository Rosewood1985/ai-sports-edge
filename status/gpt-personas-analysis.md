# GPT Personas Analysis

## Overview

This document provides an analysis of the GPT personas files in the consolidated documentation.

## Statistics

- **Total GPT Files**: 159 markdown files
- **Files with "instruction" or "prompt" in name**: 6 files
- **Potential duplicates by similar names**: None found

## Key Files

### Claude Instructions

The `claude-3.7-instructions-ai-sports-edge.md` file contains comprehensive instructions for Claude 3.7 when working on the AI Sports Edge project. Key points:

- Defines role and behavior across all modes and in Boomerang Mode specifically
- Outlines core responsibilities including code architecture and maintenance
- Emphasizes atomic design principles and modular, scalable structures
- Focuses on code quality, cleanup, and maintenance

### Olive Governance Prompts

The `olive-governance-prompts.md` file contains governance rules for file and execution clarity. Key points:

- Requires clear indication of what needs to be saved, deployed, uploaded, or logged
- Applies to all Olive responses, ChatGPT outputs, and internal team tasks
- Aims to avoid omissions or shadow edits

### Other Instruction/Prompt Files

- `claude-support-prompts-ai-sports-edge.md`
- `manual-deploy-instructions.md`
- `deployment-instructions.md`
- `update-instructions.md`

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Naming**: Consider standardizing the naming convention for instruction and prompt files to make them easier to find and manage.

2. **Centralize Instructions**: Create a central index of all instruction and prompt files to make them easier to reference.

3. **Version Control**: Implement a versioning system for instruction files to track changes over time.

4. **Categorization**: Further categorize instruction files by their purpose (e.g., deployment, development, governance).

5. **Documentation**: Add more detailed documentation about how these instruction files should be used and maintained.

## Next Steps

1. Review all instruction and prompt files to ensure they are up-to-date and consistent with current project requirements.

2. Create a standardized template for new instruction files.

3. Implement the recommendations above to improve the organization and management of GPT personas files.
