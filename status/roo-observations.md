### [system-update] @ 2025-05-13T20:52:25Z
- ✅ Implemented modular system health check script (scripts/system-health-check.sh)
- ✅ Consolidated verification tasks into a single script with pluggable modules
- ✅ Added structured logging to separate files for compliance, violations, and summary
- ✅ Updated .cronrc to run system health check every 3 days
- ℹ️ System will verify consolidation principles, atomic architecture, memory bank consistency, and narrative context tagging
- ℹ️ This approach reduces sprawl and improves maintainability by having a single entry point for system verification
