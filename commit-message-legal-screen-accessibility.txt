feat(accessibility): Integrate AccessibleThemedText and AccessibleThemedView in LegalScreen

This commit enhances the accessibility of the LegalScreen by:

- Replacing all ThemedText components with AccessibleThemedText
- Replacing all ThemedView components with AccessibleThemedView
- Adding appropriate accessibility labels for screen readers
- Using semantic type props (h1, bodyStd, etc.) for proper heading hierarchy
- Adding accessibility labels to the ScrollView for legal content
- Maintaining consistent styling while improving accessibility

These changes improve the app's accessibility compliance and provide a better
experience for users with disabilities, particularly those using screen readers
when viewing legal content such as Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
