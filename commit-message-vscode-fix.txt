fix: resolve VS Code workspace storage path issues

- Create proper .vscode directory with correct permissions
- Add settings.json with editor configuration
- Copy SFTP configuration to main .vscode directory
- Ensure code-workspace file points to correct root
- Add reset-vscode-workspace.sh script for one-click fixes
- Document fix process in docs/vscode-workspace-fix.md

This resolves the "Custom storage path is unusable" error by
ensuring VS Code can properly access and write to the workspace
configuration files. The fix maintains compatibility with all
deployment scripts and SFTP integration.
