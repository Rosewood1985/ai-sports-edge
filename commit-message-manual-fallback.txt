feat: Add manual fallback deployment script

- Created manual-fallback-deploy.sh script that:
  - Validates deployment configuration
  - Creates a zip file of the build directory
  - Provides step-by-step instructions for manual deployment via GoDaddy control panel
  - Includes commands for setting proper file permissions

This script provides a reliable fallback method for deployment when automated SFTP deployment fails, ensuring the site can still be deployed even when there are connectivity or permission issues with the automated process.
