feat(firebase): Implement atomic architecture for Firebase services

This commit begins the migration of Firebase services to atomic architecture,
providing a consolidated service for all Firebase interactions.

Key changes:
- Refactored useAuth.ts to use the consolidated firebaseService
- Updated firebase.js and firebase.ts to use atomic architecture
- Created migration script (migrate-firebase-atomic.sh) to automate the process
- Added comprehensive migration documentation

The atomic architecture provides:
- Centralized configuration and error handling
- Improved testability and maintainability
- Consistent interfaces across the application
- Reduced code duplication

Migration progress: 3/227 files (1.3%)
