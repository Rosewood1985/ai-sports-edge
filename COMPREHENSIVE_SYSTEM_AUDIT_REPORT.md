## üèÅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**GO/NO-GO**: **CONDITIONAL GO**

The AI Sports Edge application demonstrates strong technical foundations and comprehensive feature sets. However, **critical organizational and consistency issues must be addressed before production launch**. The application is technically sound but needs focused attention on file structure, multilingual support, and cross-platform consistency.

**Recommended Timeline**: 2-3 weeks additional development time to address critical issues, followed by controlled production launch with intensive monitoring.

**Risk Assessment**: **Medium** - Core functionality is solid, but user experience and maintenance issues could impact long-term success without proper remediation.
