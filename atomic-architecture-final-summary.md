## Architecture Benefits

### Maintainability

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
- **Decoupling**: Components are independent with well-defined interfaces
- **Consistency**: Uniform patterns across the codebase
- **Testability**: Isolated components are easier to test

### Performance

- **Optimized Rendering**: React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Efficient Updates**: useCallback and useMemo reduce recalculations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Bundle Optimization**: Smaller, more focused components

### Developer Experience

- **Clear Structure**: Intuitive organization following atomic design principles
- **Reusability**: Components designed for reuse across the application
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting code with clear purpose
- **Onboarding**: Easier for new developers to understand the codebase

## Tools and Scripts
