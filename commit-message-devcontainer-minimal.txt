refactor(devcontainer): simplify Docker setup for faster builds

- Reduce Dockerfile to minimal dependencies (node:18, git, curl, typescript)
- Simplify devcontainer.json to essential settings and extensions
- Remove unnecessary tools and configurations
- Forward only required Expo ports (19000-19002)
- Document changes in status/devcontainer-minimal-setup.md

This change improves container build times and reduces resource usage
while maintaining core development capabilities.
