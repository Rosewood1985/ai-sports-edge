feat: Add simple analysis script for compatibility

Adds a simplified version of the analysis tools script that doesn't rely on external dependencies. This script:

1. Creates the necessary directory structure for the analysis tools
2. Provides information about the available analysis tools
3. Lists the documentation for the analysis tools
4. Checks if the GitHub Actions workflow exists

This script is useful for:
- Quickly checking the status of the analysis tools
- Setting up the required directory structure
- Working around dependency issues with Node.js v22+
- Providing a lightweight alternative to the full analysis tools

The full analysis tools (roo-duplicates.js, roo-history-analyze.js, roo-complete-analysis.js) 
are designed to run in the CI/CD pipeline with Node.js v18 as specified in the GitHub Actions workflow.
